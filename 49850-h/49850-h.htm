      PREFACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t has been, for
      years, the cherished wish of the writer of the following pages, to make
      the Tower of London&mdash;the proudest monument of antiquity, considered
      with reference to its historical associations, which this country or any
      other possesses,&mdash;the groundwork of a Romance; and it was no slight
      satisfaction to him, that circumstances, at length, enabled him to carry
      into effect his favourite project, in conjunction with the inimitable
      Artist, whose designs accompany the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desirous of exhibiting the Tower in its triple light of a palace, a
      prison, and a fortress, the Author has shaped his story with reference to
      that end; and he has also endeavoured to contrive such a series of
      incidents as should naturally introduce every relic of the old pile,&mdash;its
      towers, chapels, halls, chambers, gateways, arches, and drawbridges&mdash;so
      that no part of it should remain un-illustrated.

      How far this design has been accomplished&mdash;what interest has been
      given to particular buildings&mdash;and what mouldering walls have been
      informed with life&mdash;is now to be determined:&mdash;unless, indeed, it
      may be considered determined by the numbers who have visited the different
      buildings, as they have been successively depicted by pen and pencil,
      during the periodical appearance of the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      One important object the Author would fain hope his labours may achieve.
      This is the introduction of the public to some parts of the fortress at
      present closed to them. There seems no reason why admission should not be
      given, under certain restrictions, to that unequalled specimen of Norman
      architecture, Saint John's Chapel in the White Tower,&mdash;to the arched
      galleries above it,&mdash;to the noble council-chamber, teeming with
      historical recollections,&mdash;to the vaulted passages&mdash;and to the
      winding staircases within the turrets&mdash;so perfect, and so interesting
      to the antiquary. Nor is there stronger reason why the prison-chamber in
      the Beauchamp Tower, now used as a mess-room, the walls of which, like a
      mystic scroll, are covered with inscriptions&mdash;each a tragic story in
      itself, and furnishing matter for abundant reflection&mdash;should not
      likewise be thrown open. Most of the old fortifications upon the inner
      ballium-wall being converted into private dwellings,&mdash;though in many
      cases the chambers are extremely curious, and rich in inscriptions,&mdash;are,
      of course, inaccessible. But this does not apply to the first-mentioned
      places. They are the property of the nation, and should be open to
      national inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is piteous to see what havoc has already been made by alterations and
      repairs. The palace is gone&mdash;so are many of the towers&mdash;and
      unless the progress of destruction is arrested, the demolition of others
      will follow. Let us attempt to preserve what remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the matchless White Tower&mdash;William of Orange by the side of
      William the Conqueror,&mdash;is that frightful architectural abomination,
      the Grand Store-House.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may not be possible to remove this ugly and incongruous structure. It
      is not possible to take away others that offend the eye at every turn. It
      is not possible to restore the Tower to its pristine grandeur. But it <i>is</i>
      possible to prevent further mutilation and desecration. It <i>is</i>
      possible to clear the reverend and massive columns of Saint John's Chapel,
      which look like giants of departed days, from the thick coat of white-wash
      in which they are crusted,&mdash;to sweep away the presses with which its
      floors are cumbered, and to find some other equally secure, but less
      interesting&mdash;less sacred, in every sense, depository for the Chancery
      rolls. It <i>is</i> possible to render the same service to the magnificent
      council-chamber, and the passages leading to it,&mdash;it <i>is</i>
      possible to clear the walls of the Beauchamp Tower,&mdash;and it <i>is</i>,
      also, possible and desirable, that the public should be admitted to these
      places, in which they have so strong an interest. The visiter to the Tower
      sees little&mdash;and <i>can</i> see little of its most curious features.
      But it is the hope of the writer, that the day is not far off, when all
      that is really worth seeing will be accessible. In this view, the present
      publication may not be without use.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those, who conceive that the Author has treated the character of Queen
      Mary with too great leniency, he can only affirm that he has written
      according to his conviction of the truth. Mary's worst fault as a woman&mdash;her
      sole fault as a sovereign&mdash;was her bigotry: and it is time that the
      cloud, which prejudice has cast over her, should be dispersed. "Let us
      judge of her dispassionately and disinterestedly," says Griffet *; "let us
      listen to the testimony of those who have known her, and have had the best
      means of examining her actions and her discourse. Let us do this, and we
      may perhaps discover that the reproaches which Protestant writers have
      heaped upon her have been excessive; and after a strict and impartial
      examination of her character, we may recognise in her qualities worthy of
      praise." To this authority may be added that of Mr. Patrick Fraser Tytler,
      and Sir Frederick Madden, the latter of whom, in his able introduction to
      the "<i>Privy Purse Expenses of the Princess Mary</i>," has most
      eloquently vindicated her.

      Presuming upon the favour which the present work has experienced, the
      Author begs to intimate that he has other chronicles of the old fortress
      in contemplation, which he hopes to find leisure to produce. Those who
      desire further insight into its history and antiquities, are referred to
      Mr. Bayley's excellent and comprehensive work on the subject,&mdash;a
      publication not so much known as it deserves to be, and from which much
      important information contained in the present volume has been derived.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be unpardonable in both Author and Illustrator, were they to omit
      to allude to the courtesy and attention they have experienced from the
      gentlemen connected with the different departments of the Tower, as well
      as from the occupants of the various fortifications. They beg, therefore,
      to offer their cordial acknowledgments to Major Elrington, fort-major and
      acting governor; to Edmund L. Swift, Esq., keeper of the regalia; to
      Robert Porrett, Esq., F. S. A., of the Principal Store-keeper's Office;
      and George Stacey, Esq., of the same; to Thomas Hardy, Esq., F. S. A.,
      keeper of the records in the Tower; to Lieutenant Hall, barrack-master;
      and to many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Author's best thanks are, also, due to Sir Henry Bedingfeld, Bart., of
      Oxburgh Hall, Norfolk, (the lineal descendant of the Lieutenant of the
      Tower introduced in the following pages,) for his obliging communications
      respecting his ancestor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," to adopt the words of old Stow, in his continuation of
      Holinshed's Chronicle, "craving a favourable acceptation of this tedious
      travail, with a toleration of all such faults, as haply therein lie
      hidden, and by diligent reading may soon be spied (especially by the
      critics), we wish that they which best may, would once in their life grow
      resolute and at a point in this laudable kind of study, most necessary for
      common knowledge, little or much to exercise their head and hand. Finally,
      beseeching God to bless these realms, and its ever precious jewel, our
      gracious Queen Victoria, and the infant princess newly given to us; to
      save them as the apple of his eye; and to protect them with the target of
      his power against all ill,&mdash;the Chronicler, in all humility, takes
      his leave."

      N the 10th of July, 1553, about two hours after noon, a loud discharge of
      ordnance burst from the turrets of Durham House, then the residence of the
      Duke of Northumberland, grand-master of the realm, and occupying the site
      of the modern range of buildings, known as the Adelphi; and, at the
      signal, which was immediately answered from every point along the river
      where a bombard or culverin could be planted,&mdash;from the adjoining
      hospital of the Savoy,&mdash;the old palace of Bridewell, recently
      converted by Edward VI., at the instance of Ridley, bishop of London, into
      a house of correction,&mdash;Baynard's Castle, the habitation of the Earl
      of Pembroke,&mdash;the gates of London-bridge,&mdash;and, lastly, from the
      batteries of the Tower,&mdash;a gallant train issued from the southern
      gateway of the stately mansion abovenamed, and descended the stairs
      leading to the water's edge, where, appointed for their reception, was
      drawn up a squadron of fifty superbly-gilt barges,&mdash;some decorated
      with banners and streamers,&mdash;some with cloth-of-gold and arras,
      embroidered with the devices of the civic companies,&mdash;others with
      innumerable silken pennons to which were attached small silver bells,
      "making a goodly noise and a goodly sight as they waved in the wind,"&mdash;while
      others, reserved for the more important personages of the ceremony, were
      covered at the sides with shields gorgeously emblazoned with the armorial
      bearings of the different noblemen and honourable persons composing the
      privy council, amid which the cognizance of the Duke of Northumberland,&mdash;a
      lion rampant, or, double quevée, <i>vert</i>,&mdash;appeared proudly
      conspicuous. Each barge was escorted by a light galley, termed a foist or
      wafter, manageable either by oar or sail as occasion demanded, and
      attached to its companion by a stout silken tow-line. In these galleys,
      besides the rowers, whose oars were shipped, and in readiness to be
      dropped, at an instant's notice, into the tide, and the men-at-arms, whose
      tall pikes, steel caps, and polished corslets flashed in the sun-beams,
      sat bands of minstrels provided with sackbuts, shalms, cornets, rebecs,
      and other forgotten musical instruments. The conduct of the whole squadron
      was entrusted to six officers, whose business it was to prevent confusion,
      and who, in the small swift wherries appointed to their use, rowed rapidly
      from place to place, endeavouring by threats and commands to maintain
      order, and keep off the crowd of boats and craft of all sorts hurrying
      towards them from every quarter of the river. It was a brilliant and busy
      scene, and might be supposed a joyous and inspiriting one&mdash;more
      especially, as the object which had called together this assemblage was
      the conveyance of a young and lovely sovereign to her throne within the
      Tower. But it was not so. Young and lovely as was that sovereign,&mdash;rich,&mdash;richer,
      perhaps, than any of her sex,&mdash;in endowments of mind and person,&mdash;illustrious
      and royal in birth,&mdash;professing and supporting a faith, then newly
      established throughout the country, and which it was feared, and with
      reason, might be greatly endangered, if not wholly subverted, if another
      and nearer claimant of the crown, the Princess Mary, had succeeded to the
      inheritance; still, with all these high recommendations,&mdash;though her
      rights were insisted upon by the ablest and most eloquent divines from the
      pulpit, though her virtues, her acquirements, and her beauty were the
      theme of every tongue;&mdash;as she was not first in the succession, and,
      above all, as she had been invested with regal authority by one who, from
      his pride, was obnoxious to all men,&mdash;her father-in-law, the Duke of
      Northumberland,&mdash;the Lady Jane Dudley's accession was viewed by all
      ranks and all parties with mistrust and apprehension. In vain had the
      haughty duke brought her with a splendid cavalcade from Sion House to his
      own palace. No cheers greeted her arrival&mdash;no rejoicings were made by
      the populace, but a sullen and ominous silence prevailed amongst those who
      witnessed her entrance into the capital. It is true that her youth and
      surpassing beauty excited the greatest interest. Murmurs of irrepressible
      admiration arose at her appearance; but these were immediately checked on
      the approach of Northumberland, who, following closely behind her, eyed
      the concourse as if he would enforce their applauses; and it was
      emphatically said, that in pity of the victim of his soaring ambition,
      more tears were shed on that occasion, than shouts were uttered. On the
      9th of July, Lady Jane Dudley&mdash;better known by her maiden title of
      Lady Jane Grey&mdash;had been made acquainted with her exalted, but, as
      she herself (with a sad presentiment of calamity) pronounced it, her fatal
      destiny. Edward the Sixth had breathed his last, three days previously.
      His death had been kept carefully concealed by Northumberland, who hoped,
      by despatching false messages, to have secured the persons of the
      princesses Mary and Elizabeth. But intelligence of her brother's death
      having been communicated to the latter, she avoided the snare; and the
      duke, finding further dissimulation useless, resolved at once to carry his
      plan into execution, and proclaim his daughter-in-law queen. With this
      view, and accompanied by several members of the privy-council, he
      proceeded to Sion House, where she was then living in retirement, and
      announced to her that the late monarch had declared her by his
      letters-patent (an instrument which he had artfully obtained) his
      successor. Jane refused the proffered dignity, urging the prior claims of
      Edward's sisters; and adding, "I am not so young, nor so little read in
      the guiles of fortune, to suffer myself to be taken by them. If she enrich
      any, it is but to make them the subject of her spoil. If she raise others,
      it is but to pleasure herself with their ruins. What she adorned but
      yesterday, is to-day her pastime: and if I now permit her to adorn and
      crown me, I must to-morrow suffer her to crush and tear me to pieces. Nay,
      with what crown does she present me? A crown which has been violently and
      shamefully wrested from Catherine of Arragon, made more unfortunate by the
      punishment of Anne Boleyn, and others who wore it after her; and why then
      would you have me add my blood to theirs, and be the third victim from
      whom this fatal crown may be ravished, with the head that wears it?" In
      this forcible and feeling language she couched her refusal; and for some
      time she adhered to her resolution, until at length, her constancy being
      shaken by the solicitations of her relatives, and above all by the
      entreaties of her husband Lord Guilford Dudley, to whom she was
      passionately attached, she yielded a reluctant assent. On the following
      morning, she was conveyed, as has been just stated, with great pomp to
      Durham House, in the Strand, where she received the homage of her
      subjects, partook of a magnificent banquet, and tarried sufficiently long
      to enable the duke to collect his retinue to conduct her in state to the
      Tower: it being then the custom for the monarchs of England to spend the
      first few days of their reign within this ancient fortress. It is with the
      moment of her departure for this palace and prison of crowned heads, that
      this chronicle commences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advanced guard of the procession was formed by a troop of halberdiers
      dressed in striped hose of black and tawny, velvet caps decked at the side
      with silver roses, and doublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on
      the front and at the back with the royal blazon, woven in gold. Their
      halbert staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt nails,
      and ornamented with golden tassels. Filing oft on the right and left, they
      formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the palace to the
      foot of the plank communicating with the barge nearest the shore. A thick
      rayed cloth was then unfolded, and laid down between them by several
      attendants in the sumptuous liveries of the Duke of Northumberland. This
      done, a flourish of trumpets resounded from within; a lively prelude arose
      from the musicians on the water; and two ushers with white wands marched
      at a slow and stately pace from the portal. They were followed by an
      officer bearing the mace; after whom came another carrying the sword of
      state; then several serjeants of the city guard, in their full
      accoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; then the garter
      king-at-arms in his tabard; then several knights of the Bath, each having
      a white laco on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in their
      robes of scarlet and coifs; then the bishop of Ely, who, in his character
      of lord high chancellor, wore a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled
      with minever; then the aldermen, likewise in cloaks of scarlet; the
      sheriffs; and, finally, the lord mayor, Sir George Beame, in a gown of
      crimson velvet, and wearing the collar of SS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sufficient time having been allowed for the embarkation of these important
      personages, who, with their attendants, filled several barges, another
      flourish of trumpets was heard, fresh symphonies resounded from the river,
      and the heads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state,
      descended and departed. Many an eye tracked their course along the river,
      which flamed like a sheet of molten gold beneath its glittering burthens.
      Many an ear listened to the measured sweep of their oars, and the
      softening cadences of their minstrelsy; lingering, enchanted, on the sight
      and sound till both faded away in the distance. Still, though a thousand
      pulses beat high, and a thousand hearts throbbed, not an acclamation was
      raised, not a. cap thrown in the air, not a scarf waved. The same silence,
      that had prevailed during the morning, prevailed now. Queen Jane, it was
      evident, was not the choice of her people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, two venerable persons had presented themselves on the
      stair-head. These were Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, and Ridley,
      bishop of London. They were attired in the scarlet simar, and surplice
      with its snowy lawn sleeves, proper to their order, and were engaged in
      deep converse together. The austere course of life prescribed to, and
      pursued by, the fathers of the Reformed Church, had stamped itself in
      lines of unusual severity on their countenances. Their demeanour was grave
      and singularly dignified, and such as well beseemed their high
      ecclesiastical rank. Arrived at the last step, Cranmer raised his eyes,
      and, after glancing around as if in expectation of some greeting from the
      multitude, observed to his companion, "This silence of the people likes me
      not, my lord: disaffection, I fear, is abroad. This is not the way in
      which our good citizens are wont to receive a triumph such as his Grace of
      Northumberland has prepared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Grace is in the right," replied Ridley. "The assemblage before whom
      I pronounced a solemn exhortation this morning at St. Paul's Cross,&mdash;when
      I proved, as I trust, satisfactorily, that Mary and Elizabeth are excluded
      from the succession on the score of illegitimacy,&mdash;received my
      discourse with murmurs of disapprobation. Vainly did I tell them if they
      accepted Mary they would relapse into darkness and idolatry: vainly did I
      enlarge on our young queen's virtues, and show them that she was prepared
      to carry into effect the wise ordinations of her pious predecessor. They
      made no answer,&mdash;but departed, as men resolved not to be convinced of
      their error."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are signs indeed of troublous times," sighed Cranmer; "and, though
      it is not given to us to foresee the future, I cannot but fear that a
      season of bitter persecution of our church is at hand. Heaven avert the
      day! Heaven preserve queen Jane, who will prove our surest safeguard! Had
      Mary ruled&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had that false bigot ruled," interrupted Ridley, frowning at the idea,
      "your grace and I should, ere this, have changed places in the Tower with
      Gardiner and Bonner. But should what you fear come to pass; should evil
      times arise, and Rome and her abominations again prevail; should our
      church need a martyr, she shall find one in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in me," rejoined Cranmer, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, twelve French gentlemen in splendid habiliments,
      consisting of pourpoints of white damask, barred with gold, short mantles
      of crimson velvet, lined with violet taffeta, and carnation-coloured
      hauts-de-chausses, took their way down the steps. These galliards, who
      formed the suite of M. Antoine de Noailles, ambassador from Henry the
      Second of France, were succeeded by a like number of Spanish cavaliers,
      the attendants of M. Simon Renard, who fulfilled the like high office for
      the emperor Charles the Fifth. Dressed in suits of black velvet, entirely
      without ornament, the Spaniards differed as much from the airy and elegant
      Frenchmen in gravity and reserve of manner, as in simplicity of apparel.
      Their leader, Simon Renard, was as plainly attired as his followers, his
      sole decoration being the Toison d'Or: but of all that brilliant
      assemblage, perhaps there was none so likely to arrest and rivet attention
      as this remarkable man; and as he is destined to play no inconsiderable
      part in this history, it may be worth while to take a narrower survey of
      his personal appearance. Somewhat above the middle height, and of a spare
      but muscular frame, he had a dark complexion, rendered yet more sombre in
      its colour from the contrast it presented to his grizzled board and
      moustaches. His eye was black and flaming, his nose long and hooked, and
      he had astern searching glance, which few could withstand. There was
      something mysterious both in his manner and character which made him
      universally dreaded; and as he never forgave an offence, nor scrupled at
      any means of gratifying his vengeance, it was not without reason that he
      was feared. A subtle politician and skilful diplomatist, high in the
      favour of the most powerful sovereign in Europe, with apparently
      inexhaustible funds at his command; inexorable in hatred, fickle in
      friendship, inconstant in affairs of gallantry, suspected of being mixed
      up in every political intrigue or conspiracy, Simon Renard had been for
      some time the terror and wonder of Edward's court, and had been regarded
      with suspicion and jealousy by Northumberland, who looked upon him as a
      dangerous opponent. During Edward's lifetime frequent quarrels had
      occurred between these two crafty statesmen; but now, at this desperate
      conjuncture, the duke deemed it prudent to forget his animosity, and to
      conciliate his antagonist. More of a courtier, and not less of a
      diplomatist, but without the skill, the resolution, or the cunning of his
      brother ambassador, De Noailles would have been no match for Renard had
      they been opposed: and, indeed, his inferiority was afterwards signally
      manifested. But they were now united by common bonds of animosity: both
      were determined enemies of Northumberland&mdash;both resolved upon his
      overthrow, and that of the queen he had placed upon the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the ambassadors entered their barge, than withdrawing out of
      earshot of their attendants, they commenced a conversation in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long will this farce last, think you?" inquired De Noailles, with a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a day&mdash;not an hour," rejoined Simon Renard, "if these suspicious
      and timorous English nobles will but act in concert, and confide in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confide in <i>you?</i>" said De Noailles, smiling. "They fear you more
      than Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will not succeed without me," returned Renard, coldly. "Mark me, De
      Noailles, I, Simon Renard, simple bailli of Amont in the Franche-Comte,
      and an unworthy representative of his Majesty Charles the Fifth, hold in
      my right hand the destiny of this fair land of England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! ha! ha!" laughed De Noailles. "You have learnt to rhodomontade at the
      court of Madrid, I perceive, Monsieur le Bailli."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is no rhodomontade, messire," rejoined the other, sternly; "were I
      to join with Northumberland and Suffolk, I could establish Jane upon the
      throne. Acting with the privy council, who, as you well know, are, like
      ourselves, the duke's secret enemies, I shall strike the sceptre from her
      grasp, and place it in the hand of Mary. Nay more, I will tell you that if
      I had not wished to ensure Northumberland's destruction, I would not have
      suffered him to proceed thus far. But he has now taken a step which
      nothing can retrieve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My hatred of him is as great as your own, M. Renard," observed De
      Noailles, gravely; "and I shall rejoice as heartily as yourself, or any of
      his enemies, in his downfall. But I cannot blind myself to his power.
      Clinton, the Lord High Admiral, his fast friend, is in possession of the
      Tower, which is full of armed men and ammunition. The royal treasures are
      in his hands; the troops, the navy, are his&mdash;and, as yet, the privy
      council have sanctioned all his decrees&mdash;have sworn obedience to Jane&mdash;have
      proclaimed Mary illegitimate, and deprived her of her inheritance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall eat their own words," replied Renard, in a sarcastic tone.
      "But it is time, De Noailles, to admit you to my full confidence. First,
      swear to me, by the holy Evangelists, that I may trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear it," replied De Noailles, "provided," he added, smiling, "your
      scheme has nothing treasonable against my liege lord, Henry the Second."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judge for yourself," answered Renard. "There is a plot hatching against
      the life of Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mortdieu!" exclaimed the French ambassador; "by whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-night you shall meet the conspirators," replied Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their names?" demanded De Noailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It matters not," answered the other; "I am their leader. Will you make
      one of us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly," rejoined the Frenchman. "But how is the duke to be put to
      death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the headsman," replied Simon Renard. "He shall die the death of a
      traitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were ever mysterious, messire," observed De Noailles, drily; "and you
      are now more mysterious than ever. But I will join your plot with all my
      heart. Pardieu! I should like to offer Northumberland's head to Queen
      Mary. It would be as acceptable as that of Cicero to Fulvia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My gift shall be yet more acceptable," rejoined Simon Renard, sternly. "I
      will offer her the fairest and the wisest head in England&mdash;that of
      Queen Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this conference, the procession had been increased by several
      members of the privy-council, consisting of the Earls of Arundel,
      Shrewsbury, Huntingdon, and Pembroke, the Lords Cobham and Rich, with
      divers other noble and honourable persons, among whom Sir William Cecil,
      principal secretary of state, (afterwards, the great Lord Burghley.) must
      not pass unnoticed. Pembroke and Cecil walked together; and, in spite of
      their forced composure, it was evident that both were ill at case. As a
      brief halt took place amongst the foremost party, Cecil seized the arm of
      his companion, and whispered hurriedly in his ear, "We are lost, my lord.
      Your messengers to the queen have been arrested; so have my trusty
      servants, Alford and Cayewood. Luckily, their despatches are in cipher.
      But Northumberland's suspicions once aroused, his vengeance will not be
      slow to follow. There is yet time for escape. Can we not frame some excuse
      for landing at your lordship's residence, Baynard's Castle? Once within
      the Tower, I tremble for our heads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My case is not so desperate as yours," returned the earl, firmly; "but
      were it so, I would never fly while others are left to pay the penalty of
      my cowardice. We have advanced too far to retreat&mdash;and, be the issue
      of this project what it may, I will not shrink from it. Simon Renard is
      leagued with us, and he alone is a match for Northumberland, or for the
      fiend himself, if opposed to him. Be of good cheer. The day will yet be
      ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I assured of Renard's sincerity," replied Cecil, "I might, indeed,
      feel more confidence. But I have detected too many of his secret practices&mdash;have
      had too much experience of his perfidy and double-dealing, to place any
      faith in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wrong him," rejoined Pembroke; "by my soul you do! As we proceed, I
      will give you proofs that will remove all apprehensions of treachery on
      his part from your mind. He has proposed a plan.&mdash;But of this anon&mdash;for,
      see!&mdash;all, save ourselves, have entered the barge. Do you mark how
      suddenly the weather has changed? A thunder-storm is gathering over the
      Tower. 'Tis a bad omen for Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or for us," rejoined Cecil, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden change in the weather, here alluded to, was remarked and
      commented upon by many others besides the Earl of Pembroke; and by most it
      was regarded as an evil augury against the young queen. The sky had become
      overcast; the river, lately so smiling, now reflected only the sombre
      clouds that overshadowed it; while heavy, leaden-coloured masses, arising
      in the north-east, behind the Tower, seemed to threaten a speedy and
      severe storm in that quarter. Alarmed by these signs, several of the more
      prudent spectators, who preferred a dry skin to the further indulgence of
      their curiosity, began to urge their barks homewards. The majority of the
      assemblage, however, lingered: a glimpse of a queen so beautiful as Jane
      was reputed, appeared to them well worth a little personal inconvenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, a loud and prolonged trumpet-blast proclaimed the approach of
      the Duke of Northumberland. He was accompanied by the Duke of Suffolk, the
      father of the queen. Nothing more majestic can be conceived than the
      deportment of the former&mdash;nothing more magnificent than his attire.
      His features, though haughty and disdainful, with a fierce expression
      about the mouth and eyes, were remarkably handsome and well-formed. His
      figure was tall and commanding, and there was something which is generally
      associated with the epithets chivalrous and picturesque in his appearance.
      John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who by his genius and rare abilities
      as a statesman had elevated himself to the lofty position which he now
      held, could not be less in age than fifty. But he had none of the
      infirmity of years about him. His forehead was bald, but that only gave
      expanse to his noble countenance; his step was as firm as a young man's;
      his eye as keen and bright as that of an eagle. He was habited in a
      doublet of white satin, with a placard or front-piece of purple cloth of
      tissue, powdered with diamonds and edged with ermine. Over this he wore a
      mantle of cloth of silver, pounced with his cipher, lined with blue
      velvet, set with pearls and precious stones, and fastened with a jewelled
      clasp. From his neck was suspended the order of the Garter, while in his
      hand he carried the silver verder belonging to his office as grand-master
      of the realm. The Duke of Suffolk was scarcely less magnificently arrayed,
      in a doublet of black cloth of gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered
      with gold, and ribanded with nets of silver. He also wore the order of the
      Garter. Suffolk was somewhat younger than his companion, of whom he stood,
      as indeed did all the other nobles, greatly in awe. He had well-formed
      features, a fine figure, a courtly air, and affable and conciliating
      manners; but though a man of unquestionable ability and courage, he wanted
      that discernment and active resolution which alone could have preserved
      him from the dangers and difficulties in which he was afterwards involved.
      His qualities have been admirably summed up by Holinshed, who describes
      him as "a man of high nobility by birth, and of nature to his friend
      gentle and courteous; more easy indeed to be led than was thought
      expedient, nevertheless stout and hardy; hasty and soon kindled, but
      pacified straight again, and sorry if in his heat aught had passed him
      otherwise than reason might seem to bear; upright and plain in his private
      dealings; no dissembler, nor well able to bear injuries; but yet forgiving
      and forgetting the same, if the party would but seem to acknowledge his
      fault and seek reconcilement; bountiful he was, and very liberal; somewhat
      learned himself, and a great favourer of those that were learned, so that
      to many he showed himself a very Maecenas; as free from covetousness, as
      devoid of pride and disdainful haughtiness of mind, more regarding
      plain-meaning men than clawback flatterers." Such, as depicted by the
      honest old chronicler above-named, was Henry Grey, Duke of Suffolk, father
      of Queen Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the two dukes emerged from the portal, a slight commotion was
      heard in the outer court, and a valet, stepping forward, made a profound
      reverence to Northumberland, and presented him with a paper. The duke
      broke the silken thread and seal with which it was fastened, and ran his
      eye rapidly over its contents. His brow darkened for an instant, but as
      speedily cleared, and a smile of fierce satisfaction played upon his lips.
      "Traitors!" he ejaculated in an under tone, turning to Suffolk; "but I
      have them now; and, by God's precious soul! they shall not escape me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What new treason has come to light, brother!" demanded the Duke of
      Suffolk, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing new,&mdash;nothing but what I suspected. But their plots have
      taken a more dangerous and decided form," replied Northumberland, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not name the traitors,&mdash;but you speak of the privy-council, I
      conclude?" observed Suffolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, brother, of the privy-council. They are all <i>my</i> enemies,&mdash;<i>your</i>
      enemies,&mdash;the <i>queen's</i> enemies. This scroll warns me that a
      conspiracy is forming against my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid!" ejaculated Suffolk. "Surely, our English nobles are not
      turned assassins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The chief mover in the dark scheme is not an Englishman," returned
      Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be the light-hearted De Noailles. Ha! I have it: it is the
      plotting and perfidious Simon Renard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Grace is in the right," replied Northumberland; "it <i>is</i> Simon
      Renard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are his associates?" inquired Suffolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As yet I know not," answered the other; "but I have netted them all, and,
      like the fowler, will spare neither bird of prey nor harmless songster. I
      have a trick shall test the true metal from the false. What think you,
      brother?&mdash;a letter has arrived from Mary to this false council,
      claiming the crown.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Suffolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is here," continued Northumberland, pointing to a paper folded round
      his silver staff. "I shall lay it before them anon. Before I depart, I
      must give orders for the proclamation. Bid the heralds come hither," he
      added to the attendant; who instantly departed, and returned a moment
      afterwards, followed by two heralds in their coats of arms. "Take this
      scroll," continued the duke, "and let the Queens Highness be proclaimed by
      sound of trumpet at the cross at Charing, in Cheapside, and in
      Fleet-street. Take with you a sufficient guard, and if any murmuring ensue
      let the offenders be punished. Do you mark me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do, your Grace," replied the heralds, bowing. And, taking the
      proclamation, they departed on their behest,&mdash;while the duke,
      accompanied by Suffolk, entered his barge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preceded by two trumpeters, having their clarions richly dressed with
      fringed silk bandrols, displaying the royal arms; a captain of the guard,
      in a suit of scarlet bound with black velvet, and with a silver rose in
      his bonnet, next descended the stairs, and announced, in a loud and
      authoritative voice, that her Highness the Queen was about to embark: an
      intimation, which, though received with no particular demonstration of
      enthusiasm or delight by the spectators, was, nevertheless, productive of
      considerable confusion among them. The more distant wherrymen, who had
      been hitherto resting tranquilly on their oars, in their anxiety to secure
      a better position for their fares, now pressed eagerly forward; in
      consequence of which many violent collisions took place; great damage was
      sustained by the foremost boats, some being swamped and their owners
      plunged in the tide; while others, bereft of their oars, were swept away
      by the rapid current. Amid this tumult, much struggling and scuffling
      occurred; shrieks and oaths were uttered; and many blows from sword,
      dagger, and club were dealt, and requited with the heartiest good-will.
      Owing, however, to the exertions of the officers, no lives were lost. The
      drowning persons were picked up and carried ashore; and the disputants
      compelled to hold their peace, and reserve the adjustment of their
      differences to another, and more favourable opportunity. By the time Jane
      appeared, all was comparatively quiet. But the incident had not tended to
      improve the temper of the crowd, or create a stronger feeling in her
      favour. Added to this, the storm seemed fast advancing and ready to burst
      over their heads; the sky grew darker each moment; and when a second
      discharge of ordnance was bred from the palace walls, and rolled sullenly
      along the river, it was answered by a distant peal of thunder. In spite of
      all these adverse circumstances, no delay occurred in the procession. A
      magnificent barge, with two large banners, beaten with the royal arms,
      planted on the foreship, approached the strand. Its sides were hung with
      metal scutcheons, alternately emblazoned with the cognizances of the queen
      and her consort; and its decks covered with the richest silks and tissues.
      It was attended by two smaller galleys&mdash;one of which, designated the
      Bachelors' barge, was appropriated to the younger sons of the nobility:
      the other was devoted to the maids of honour. In the latter was placed a
      quaint device, intended to represent a mount with a silver tree springing
      from it, on which was perched a dove with a circlet of diamonds around its
      neck, bearing an inscription in honour of the queen, and a crown upon its
      head. No sooner had the royal barge taken up its position, than a train of
      twenty gentlemen, in doublets of black velvet and with chains of gold,
      stepped towards it. They were followed by six pages in vests of cloth of
      gold; after whom came the Earl of Northampton, lord high chamberlain,
      bareheaded, and carrying a white wand; and after the chamberlain, appeared
      the Lady Herbert, younger sister of the queen, a beautiful blonde, with
      soft blue eyes and silken tresses, accompanied by the Lady Hastings,
      younger sister of Lord Guilford Dudley, a sprightly brunette, with large
      orient orbs, black as midnight, and a step proud as that of a Juno. Both
      these lovely creatures&mdash;neither of whom had attained her fifteenth
      year&mdash;had been married at the end of May&mdash;then, as now, esteemed
      an unlucky month,&mdash;on the sumo day that the nuptials of the Lady Jane
      Grey took place. Of these three marriages there was not one but was
      attended with fatal consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately behind her sisters, with the laps of her dress supported by
      the bishops of Rochester and Winchester, and her train, which was of great
      length and corresponding magnificence, borne by her mother, the duchess of
      Suffolk, walked queen Jane. Whatever disinclination she might have
      previously shown to undertake the dangerous and difficult part she had
      assumed; however reluctantly she had accepted the sovereignty; nothing of
      misgiving or irresolution was now to be discerned. Her carriage was
      majestic; her look lofty, yet tempered with such sweetness, that while it
      commanded respect, it ensured attachment. Her attire&mdash;for the only
      point upon which Jane did not conform to the rigid notions of the early
      religious reformers was in regard to dress&mdash;was gorgeous in the
      extreme; and never, assuredly, was rich costume bestowed upon a more
      faultlessly beautiful person. Her figure was tall and slight, but
      exquisitely formed, and gave promise, that when she attained the full
      maturity of womanhood&mdash;she had only just completed her sixteenth
      year, and (alas!) never <i>did</i> attain maturity&mdash;her charms would
      be without a rival. In mental qualifications Jane was equally gifted. And,
      if it is to be lamented that her beauty, like an opening flower, was
      rudely plucked and scattered to the breezes, how much more must it be
      regretted, that such faculties as she possessed should have been destroyed
      before they were fully developed, and the fruit they might have produced
      lost for ever! Reared in the seclusion of Bradgate, in Leicestershire,
      Jane Grey passed hours which other maidens of her tender age are
      accustomed to devote to amusement or rest, in the severest study; and,
      long before she was called upon to perform the arduous duties of her brief
      life, she had acquired a fund of knowledge such as the profoundest
      scholars seldom obtain. If this store of learning did little for the
      world, it did much for herself:&mdash;it taught her a philosophy, that
      enabled her to support, with the constancy of a martyr, her after trials.
      At the moment of her presentation to the reader, Jane was in all the flush
      and excitement of her new dignity. Everything around her was dazzling and
      delusive; but she was neither dazzled nor deluded. She estimated her
      position at its true value; saw through its hollowness and
      unsubstantiality; and, aware that she only grasped the shadow of a
      sceptre, and bore the semblance of a crown, suffered neither look nor
      gesture to betray her emotions. Her dress consisted of a gown of cloth of
      gold raised with pearls, a stomacher blazing with diamonds and other
      precious stones, and a surcoat of purple velvet bordered with ermine. Her
      train was of purple velvet upon velvet, likewise furred with ermine, and
      embroidered with various devices in gold. Her slender and swan-like throat
      was encircled with a carcanet of gold set with rubies and pearls, from
      which a single and almost priceless pearl depended. Her head-dress
      consisted of a coif of velvet of the peculiar form then in vogue, adorned
      with rows of pearls, and confined by a circlet of gold. At her right
      walked Lord Guilford Dudley&mdash;a youthful nobleman, who inherited his
      father's manly beauty and chivalrous look, with much of his ambition and
      haughtiness, but without any of his cunning and duplicity, or of his
      genius. He was superbly attired in white cloth of gold, and wore a collar
      of diamonds. Behind the queen marched a long train of high-born dames,
      damsels, youthful nobles, pages, knights, esquires, and ushers, until the
      rear-guard was brought up by a second detachment of halberdiers. Prepared
      as the mass of the assemblage were to evidence their dissatisfaction by
      silence, an involuntary burst of applause hailed her approach, and many,
      who thought it a sort of disloyalty to Mary to welcome a usurper, could
      not refuse to join in the cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Jane was crossing the railed plank leading to her galley, a
      small wherry, rowed by a young man of slight sinewy frame, clad in a
      doublet of coarse brown serge, and wearing a flat felt cap, on which a
      white cross was stitched, shot with marvellous rapidity from out the
      foremost line of boats, and, in spite of all opposition, passed between
      the state barges, and drew up at her feet. Before the daring intruder
      could be removed, an old woman, seated in the stern of the boat, arose and
      extended her arms towards Jane. She was dressed in mean attire, with her
      grey locks gathered beneath an ancient three-cornered coif; but her
      physiognomy was striking, and her manner seemed far above her lowly
      condition. Fixing an imploring glance on the queen, she cried&mdash;"A
      boon! a boon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is granted," replied Jane, in a kind tone, and pausing. "What would
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Preserve you," rejoined the old woman. "Go not to the Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And wherefore not, good dame?" inquired the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask me not," returned the old woman,&mdash;her figure dilating, her eye
      kindling, and her gesture becoming almost that of command, as she spoke,&mdash;"Ask
      me not; but take my warning. Again, I say&mdash;Go not to the Tower.
      Danger lurks therein,&mdash;danger to you&mdash;your husband&mdash;and to
      all you hold dear. Return, while it is yet time; return to the retirement
      of Sion House&mdash;to the solitudes of Bradgate.&mdash;Put off those
      royal robes&mdash;restore the crown to her from whom you wrested it, and a
      long and happy life shall be yours. But set foot within that galley&mdash;enter
      the gates of the Tower&mdash;and another year shall not pass over your
      head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guards!" cried Lord Guilford Dudley, advancing and motioning to his
      attendants&mdash;"remove this beldame and her companion, and place them in
      arrest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have patience, my dear lord," said Jane, in a voice so sweet, that it was
      impossible to resist it&mdash;"the poor woman is distraught."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, lady, I am not distraught," rejoined the old woman, "though I have
      suffered enough to make me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I relieve your distresses?" inquired Jane, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In no other way than by following my caution," answered the old woman. "I
      want nothing but a grave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you that dare to hold such language as this to your queen?"
      demanded Lord Guilford Dudley, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am Gunnora Braose," replied the old woman, fixing a withering glance
      upon him, "nurse and foster-mother to Henry Seymour, Duke of Somerset,
      lord protector of England, who perished on the scaffold by the foul
      practices of your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman," rejoined Lord Guilford, in a menacing tone, "be warned by me. You
      speak at the peril of your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it," replied Gunnora; "but that shall not hinder me. If I succeed
      in saving that fair young creature, whom your father's arts have placed in
      such fearful jeopardy, from certain destruction, I care not what becomes
      of me. My boldness, I am well assured, will be fearfully visited upon me,
      and upon my grandson at my side. But were it the last word I had to utter,&mdash;were
      this boy's life," she added, laying her hand on the youth's shoulder, who
      arose at the touch, "set against hers, I would repeat my warning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remove your cap in presence of the queen, knave," cried one of the
      halberdiers, striking off the young man's cap with his staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is not my queen," rejoined the youth, boldly; "I am for Queen Mary,
      whom Heaven and Our Lady preserve!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace, Gilbert!" cried Gunnora, authoritatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Treason! treason!" exclaimed several voices&mdash;"down with them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do them no injury," interposed Jane, waving her hand; "let them depart
      freely. Set forward, my lords."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me, sovereign lady, before I am driven from you," cried the old
      woman, in accents of passionate supplication&mdash;"hear me, I implore
      you. You are going to a prison, not a palace.&mdash;Look at yon angry sky
      from which the red lightning is flashing. A moment since it was bright and
      smiling; at your approach it has become black and overcast. It is an omen
      not to be despised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hence!" cried Lord Guilford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Lord Guilford Dudley," continued Gunnora, in a stern tone,&mdash;"you,
      who have added your voice to that of your false father, to induce your
      bride to accept the crown,&mdash;think not you will ever rule this
      kingdom,&mdash;think not the supreme authority will be yours. You are a
      puppet in your father's hands; and when you have served his turn, he will
      cast you aside&mdash;or deal with you as he dealt with Lord Seymour of
      Dudley,&mdash;with the lord protector, <i>by the axe</i>,&mdash;or, as he
      dealt with his sovereign, Edward the Sixth, <i>by poison</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This passeth all endurance," exclaimed Lord Guilford;&mdash;"away with
      her to prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, my dear lord," said Queen Jane. "See you not that her supposed
      wrongs have turned her brain? She is faithful to the memory of the lord
      protector. If my reign prove as brief as she would have me believe it will
      be, it shall never be marked by severity. My first act shall be one of
      clemency. Take this ring, my poor woman," she added, detaching a brilliant
      from her taper finger, "and when you need a friend, apply to Queen Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gunnora received the costly gift with a look of speechless gratitude; the
      tears started to her eyes, and she sank upon her knees in the boat,
      burying her face in her hands. In this state, she was rowed swiftly away
      by her grandson, while the loudest shouts were raised for the munificence
      and mercy of Jane, who was not sorry to hide herself behind the silken
      curtains of her barge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, a loud and rattling peal of thunder burst overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated beneath a canopy of state, supported by the richest silken
      cushions, and with her tiny feet resting upon a velvet footstool, adorned
      with her cipher and that of her husband interwoven with love-knots, Jane
      proceeded along the river; her heart oppressed with fears and forebodings,
      to which she gave no utterance, but which the storm now raging around with
      frightful violence was not calculated to allay. The thunder was awfully
      loud; the lightning almost insupportably vivid; but fortunately for those
      exposed to the tempest, it was unattended with rain. Lord Guilford Dudley
      was unremitting in his assiduity to his lovely consort, and bitterly
      reproached himself for allowing her to set forth at such a season. As they
      approached that part of the river from which the noble old gothic
      cathedral of St. Paul's&mdash;one of the finest structures in the world,
      and destroyed, it is almost needless to say, by the Fire of London, when
      it was succeeded by the present pile&mdash;was best seen, Jane drew aside
      the curtains of her barge, and gazed with the utmost admiration upon the
      magnificent fane. The storm seemed to hang over its square and massive
      tower, and flashes of forked lightning of dazzling brightness appeared to
      shoot down each instant upon the body of the edifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like me, it is threatened," Jane mentally ejaculated; "and perhaps the
      blow that strikes me may strike also the religion of my country. Whatever
      betide me, Heaven grant that that noble pile may never again be polluted
      by the superstitious ceremonies and idolatries of Rome!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed from the Thames, London, even in our own time, presents many
      picturesque and beautiful points; but at the period to which this
      chronicle refers, it must have presented a thousand more. Then, gardens
      and stately palaces adorned its banks; then, the spires and towers of the
      churches shot into an atmosphere unpolluted by smoke; then, the houses,
      with their fanciful gables, and vanes, and tall twisted chimneys, invited
      and enchained the eye; then, the streets, of which a passing glimpse could
      be caught, were narrow and intricate: then, there was the sombre,
      dungeon-like strong-hold already alluded to, called Baynard's Castle; the
      ancient tavern of the Three Cranes; the Still-yard; and above all, the
      Bridge, even then old, with its gateways, towers, drawbridges, houses,
      mills, and chapel,-enshrined like a hidden and cherished faith within its
      inmost heart. All this has passed away. But if we have no old St. Paul's,
      no old London Bridge, no quaint and picturesque old fabrics, no old and
      frowning castles, no old taverns, no old wharfs&mdash;if we have none of
      these, we have still <i>the Tower</i>; and to that grand relic of
      antiquity, well worth all the rest, we shall, without further delay,
      proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having passed beneath the narrow arches of London Bridge, the houses on
      which were crowded with spectators, and the windows hung with arras and
      rich carpets, the royal barge drew up at the distance of a bow-shot from
      the Tower. Jane again drew aside the curtain, and when she beheld the
      sullen ramparts of the fortress over which arose its lofty citadel (the
      White Tower), with its weather-whitened walls relieved against the dusky
      sky, and looking like the spectre of departed greatness,&mdash;her
      firmness for an instant forsook her, and the tears involuntarily started
      to her eyes. But the feeling was transient; and more stirring emotions
      were quickly aroused by the deafening roar of ordnance which broke from
      the batteries, and which was instantly answered from the guns of several
      ships lying at anchor near them. By this time, the storm had in a great
      measure subsided; the thunder had become more distant, and the lightning
      only flashed at long intervals. Still, the sky had an ominous appearance,
      and the blue electric atmosphere in which the pageant was enveloped gave
      it a ghostly and unsubstantial look. Meanwhile, the lord mayor and his
      suite, the bishops, the privy council, the ambassadors, and the Dukes of
      Northumberland and Suffolk, having disembarked, the wafter having the
      charge of the royal galley drew it towards the land. Another "marvellous
      great shot," as it is described, was then fired, and amid flourishes of
      trumpets, peals of ordnance, and ringing of bells, Jane landed. Here,
      however, as heretofore, she was coldly received by the citizens, who
      hovered around in boats,&mdash;and here, as if she was destined to receive
      her final warning, the last sullen peal of thunder marked the moment when
      she set her foot on the ground. The same preparations had been made for
      her landing as for her embarkation. Two lines of halberdiers were drawn up
      alongside the platform, and between them was laid a carpet similar to that
      previously used. Jane walked in the same state as before,&mdash;her train
      supported by her mother,&mdash;and attended on her right hand by her
      husband, behind whom came his esquire, the young and blooming Cuthbert
      Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where there are so many claimants for attention, it is impossible to
      particularize all; and we must plead this as an apology for not
      introducing this gallant at an earlier period. To repair the omission, it
      may now be stated that Cuthbert Cholmondeley was a younger branch of an
      old Cheshire family; that he was accounted a perfect model of manly
      beauty; and that he was attired upon the present occasion in a doublet of
      white satin slashed with blue, which displayed his slight but symmetrical
      figure to the greatest advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding along the platform by the side of a low wall which guarded the
      southern moat, Jane passed under a narrow archway formed by a small
      embattled tower connected with an external range of walls facing Petty
      Wales. She next traversed part of the space between what was then called
      the Bulwark Gate and the Lion's Gate, and which was filled with armed men,
      and passing through the postern, crossed a narrow stone bridge. This
      brought her to a strong portal, flanked with bastions and defended by a
      double portcullis, at that time designated the Middle Tower. Here Lord
      Clinton, Constable of the Tower, with the lieutenant, the gentleman
      porter, and a company of warders, advanced to meet her. By them she was
      conducted with much ceremony over another stone bridge, with a drawbridge
      in the centre, crossing the larger moat, to a second strong barbican,
      similarly defended and in all other respects resembling the first,
      denominated the Gate Tower. As she approached this portal, she beheld
      through its gothic arch a large assemblage, consisting of all the
      principal persons who had assisted at the previous ceremonial, drawn up to
      receive her. As soon as she emerged from the gateway with her retinue, the
      members of the council bent the knee before her. The Duke of
      Northumberland offered her the keys of the Tower, while the Marquess of
      Winchester, lord treasurer, tendered her the crown.

    </h5>
    <p>
      At this proud moment, all Jane's fears were forgotten, and she felt
      herself in reality a queen. At this moment, also, her enemies, Simon
      Renard and De Noailles, resolved upon her destruction. At this moment,
      Cuthbert Cholmondeley, who was placed a little to the left of the queen,
      discovered amid the by-standers behind one of the warders a face so
      exquisitely beautiful, and a pair of eyes of such witchery, that his heart
      was instantly captivated; and at this moment, also, another pair of very
      jealous-looking eyes, peering out of a window in the tower adjoining the
      gateway, detected what was passing between the youthful couple below, and
      inflamed their owner with a fierce and burning desire of revenge.

    <h2>
      II.-OF THE INDIGNITY SHOWN TO THE PRIVY COUNCIL BY THE DUKE OF
      NORTHUMBERLAND; AND OF THE RESOLUTION TAKEN BY SIMON RENARD TO AVENGE
      THEM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the ceremonial
      at the Tower gate was ended, Queen Jane was conducted by the Duke of
      Northumberland to an ancient range of buildings, standing at the
      south-east of the fortress, between the Lanthorn Tower, now swept away,
      and the Salt Tower. This structure, which has long since disappeared,
      formed the palace of the old monarchs of England, and contained the royal
      apartments. Towards it Jane proceeded between closely-serried ranks of
      archers and arquebusiers, armed with long-bows and calivers. The whole
      line of fortifications, as she passed along, bristled with partizans and
      pikes. The battlements and turrets of St. Thomas's Tower, beneath which
      yawned the broad black arch spanning the Traitor's Gate, was planted with
      culverins and sakers; while a glimpse through the grim portal of the
      Bloody Tower,&mdash;which, with its iron teeth, seemed ever ready to
      swallow up the victims brought through the fatal gate opposite it,&mdash;showed
      that the vast area and green in front of the White Tower was filled with
      troops. All these defensive preparations, ostentatiously displayed by
      Northumberland, produced much of the effect he desired upon the more
      timorous of his adversaries. There were others, however, who regarded the
      exhibition as an evidence of weakness, rather than power; and amongst
      these was Simon Renard. "Our duke, I see," he remarked to his companion,
      De Noailles, "fears Mary more than he would have us believe. The crown
      that requires so much guarding cannot be very secure. Ah! well, he has
      entered the Tower by the great gate to-day; but if he ever quits it," he
      added, glancing significantly at the dark opening of Traitors Gate, which
      they wero then passing, "his next entrance shall be by yonder steps."
      Jane, meanwhile, had approached the ancient palace with her train. Its
      arched gothic doorway was guarded by three gigantic warders, brothers,
      who, claiming direct descent from the late monarch, Harry the Eighth, were
      nicknamed by their companions, from their extraordinary stature, Og, Gog,
      and Magog. Og, the eldest of the three, was the exact image, on a large
      scale, of his royal sire. By their side, as if for the sake of contrast,
      with an immense halbert in his hand, and a look of swelling importance,
      rivalling that of the frog in the fable, stood a diminutive but full-grown
      being, not two feet high, dressed in the garb of a page. This mannikin,
      who, besides his dressed figure, had a malicious and ill-favoured
      countenance, with a shock head of yellow hair, was a constant attendant
      upon the giants, and an endless source of diversion to them. Xit&mdash;for
      so was the dwarf named&mdash;had been found, when an infant, and scarcely
      bigger than a thumb, one morning at Og's door, where he was placed in the
      fragment of a blanket, probably out of ridicule. Thrown thus upon his
      compassion, the good-humoured giant adopted the tiny foundling, and he
      became, as has been stated, a constant attendant and playmate&mdash;or,
      more properly, plaything&mdash;of himself and his brethren. Unable to
      repress a smile at the ludicrous dignity of the dwarf, who, advancing a
      few steps towards her, made her a profound salutation as she passed, and
      bade her welcome in a voice as shrill as a child's treble; nor less struck
      with the herculean frames and huge stature of his companions,&mdash;they
      were all nearly eight feet high, though Magog exceeded his brethren by an
      inch;&mdash;Jane ascended a magnificent oaken staircase, traversed a long
      gallery, and entered a spacious but gloomy-looking hall, lighted by narrow
      gothic windows filled with stained glass, and hung with tarnished cloth of
      gold curtains and faded arras. The furniture was cumbrous, though
      splendid,&mdash;much of it belonging to the period of Henry the Seventh,
      though some of it dated as far back as the reign of Edward the Third, when
      John of France was detained a prisoner within the Tower, and feasted by
      his royal captor within this very chamber. The walls being of great
      thickness, the windows had deep embrasures, and around the upper part of
      the room ran a gallery. It was in precisely the same state as when
      occupied by Henry the Eighth, whose portrait, painted by Holbein, was
      placed over the immense chimney-piece; and as Jane gazed around, and
      thought how many monarchs had entered this room before her full of hope
      and confidence,&mdash;how with all their greatness they had passed away,&mdash;she
      became so powerfully affected, that she trembled, and could with
      difficulty support herself. Remarking her change of colour, and
      conjecturing the cause, Northumberland begged her to retire for a short
      time to repose herself before she proceeded to the council-chamber within
      the White Tower, where her presence was required on business of the utmost
      moment. Gladly availing herself of the suggestion, Jane, attended by her
      mother and her dames of honour, withdrew into an inner chamber. On her
      departure, several of the privy-councillors advanced towards the duke,
      but, after returning brief answers to their questions, in a tone
      calculated to cut short any attempt at conversation, he motioned towards
      him two ushers, and despatched them on different errands. He then turned
      to the Duke of Suffolk, who was standing by his side, and was soon engaged
      in deep and earnest discourse with him. Aware that they were suspected,
      and alarmed for their safety, the conspiring nobles took counsel together
      as to the course they should pursue. Some were for openly defying
      Northumberland,&mdash;some for a speedy retreat,&mdash;some for the
      abandonment of their project,&mdash;while others, more confident, affirmed
      that the Duke would not dare to take any severe measures, and, therefore,
      there was no ground for apprehension. Amid these conflicting opinions,
      Simon Renard maintained his accustomed composure. "It is plain," he said
      to the group around him, "that the Duke's suspicions are awakened, and
      that he meditates some reprisal. What it is will presently be seen. But
      trust in me, and you shall yet wear your heads upon your shoulders."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the expiration of a quarter of an hour, the Queen, who had been
      summoned by Lord Guilford Dudley, reappeared. The great door was then
      instantly thrown open by two officials with white wands, and, attended by
      Northumberland, to whom she gave her hand, traversing a second long
      gallery, she descended a broad flight of steps, and entered upon another
      range of buildings, which has since shared the fate of the old palace, but
      which then, extending in a northerly direction, and flanked on the right
      by a fortification denominated the Wardrobe Tower, connected the royal
      apartments with the White Tower. Taking her way through various halls,
      chambers, and passages in this pile, Jane, at length, arrived at the foot
      of a wide stone staircase, on mounting which she found herself in a large
      and lofty chamber, with a massive roof crossed and supported by ponderous
      beams of timber. This room, which was situated within the White Tower, and
      which Jane was apprised adjoined the council-chamber, was filled with
      armed men. Smiling at this formidable assemblage, Northumberland directed
      the Queen towards a circular-arched opening in the wall on the right, and
      led her into a narrow vaulted gallery formed in the thickness of the wall.
      A few steps brought them to another narrow gallery, branching off on the
      left, along which they proceeded. Arrived at a wide opening in the wall, a
      thick curtain was then drawn aside by two attendants, and Jane was ushered
      into the council-chamber. The sight which met her gaze was magnificent
      beyond description. The vast hall, resembling in all respects the
      antechamber she had just quitted, except that it was infinitely more
      spacious, with its massive roof hung with banners and its wooden pillars
      decorated with velvet and tapestry, was crowded to excess with all the
      principal persons and their attendants who had formed her retinue in her
      passage along the river, grouped according to their respective ranks. At
      the upper end of the chamber, beneath a golden canopy, was placed the
      throne; on the right of which stood the members of the privy-council, and
      on the left the bishops. Opposite to the throne, at the lower extremity of
      the room, the walls were hung with a thick curtain of black velvet, on
      which was displayed a large silver scutcheon charged with the royal
      blasen. Before this curtain was drawn up a line of arquebusiers, each with
      a caliver upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the Queen seated, than Northumberland, who had placed
      himself at the foot of the throne, prostrated himself, and besought her
      permission to lay before the lords of the council a despatch, just
      received from the Lady Mary; which being accorded, he arose, and, turning
      towards them, unfolded a paper, and addressed them in a stern tone as
      follows:&mdash;"My lords," he began, "it will scarcely surprise you to be
      informed that the Lady Mary, in the letter I here hold, given under her
      signet, and dated from Kenninghall in Norfolk, lays claim to the imperial
      crown of this realm, and requires and charges you, of your allegiance,
      which you owe to her, and to none other,&mdash;it is so written, my lords,&mdash;to
      employ yourselves for the honour and surety of her person only; and
      furthermore, to cause her right and title to the crown and government of
      the realm to be proclaimed within the city of London and other places, as
      to your wisdoms shall seem good. Now, my lords, what say you? What answer
      will you make to these insolent demands&mdash;to these idle and imaginary
      claims?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None whatever," replied the Earl of Pembroke; "we will treat them with
      the scorn they merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may not be, my lord," observed Queen Jane; "your silence will be
      misconstrued."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, marry will it," rejoined Northumberland, glancing fiercely at the
      Earl; "and your advice, my lord of Pembroke, savours strongly of
      disloyalty. I will tell you how you shall answer this misguided lady. You
      shall advertise her, firstly, that on the death of our sovereign lord,
      Edward the Sixth, Queen Jane became invested and possessed with the just
      and right title in the imperial crown of this realm, not only by good
      order of ancient laws, but also by our late sovereign lord's letters
      patent, signed with his own hand, and sealed with the great seal of
      England, in presence of the most part of the nobles, councillors, judges,
      and divers other grave and sage personages, assenting to and subscribing
      the same. You shall next tell her, that having sworn allegiance to Queen
      Jane, you can offer it to no other, except you would fall into grievous
      and unspeakable enormities. You shall also remind her, that by the divorce
      made between the king of famous memory, King Henry the Eighth, and the
      lady Catherine her mother, confirmed by sundry acts of parliament yet in
      force, she was justly made illegitimate and unheritable to the crown of
      this realm. And lastly, you shall require her to surcease, by any
      pretence, to vex and molest our sovereign lady Queen Jane, or her subjects
      from their true faith and allegiance unto her grace. This, my lords, is
      the answer you shall return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will consider of it," cried several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your decision must be speedy," returned the Duke, scornfully; "a
      messenger waits without, to convey your reply to the Lady Mary. And to
      spare your lordships any trouble in penning the despatch, I have already
      prepared it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prepared it!" ejaculated Cecil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, prepared it," repeated the Duke. "It is here," he added, producing a
      parchment, "fairly enough written, and only lacking your lordships'
      signatures. Will it please you, Sir William Cecil, or you, my lord of
      Pembroke, or you, Shrewsbury, to cast an eye over it, to see whether it
      differs in aught from what I have counselled as a fitting answer to Mary's
      insolent message? You are silent: then, I may conclude you are satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace concludes more than you have warrant for," rejoined the Earl
      of Pembroke; "I am <i>not</i> satisfied, nor will I subscribe that
      letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," added Cecil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," repeated several others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see," returned Northumberland: "bring pen and ink," he added,
      motioning to an attendant, by whom his commands were instantly obeyed.
      "Your grace of Canterbury," he continued, addressing Cranmer, "will sign
      it first. 'Tis well. And now, my lord Marquess of Winchester, your
      signature; my lord Bedford, yours; now yours, Northampton; yours, my lord
      chancellor; next, I shall attach my own; and now yours, brother of
      Suffolk. You see, my lords," he said, with a bitter smile, "you will be
      well kept in countenance."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Simon Renard, who stood among the throng of
      privy-councillors, observed in a whisper to those nearest him,&mdash;"If
      this despatch is signed and sent forth, Mary's hopes are ruined. She will
      suspect some treachery on the part of her friends, and immediately embark
      for France, which is what Northumberland desires to accomplish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His scheme shall be defeated, then," replied Pembroke; "it never shall be
      signed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be not too sure of that," rejoined Renard, with a scarcely-repressed
      sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, my lord of Arundel," said the Duke, taking the document from
      Suffolk, "we tarry for your signature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your grace must tarry still longer," replied Arundel, sullenly, "for
      I am in no mood to furnish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Northumberland, fiercely,&mdash;but, instantly checking
      himself, he turned to the next peer, and continued: "I will pass on, then,
      to you, Lord Shrewsbury. I am assured of <i>your</i> loyalty. What! do
      you, too, desert your queen? God's mercy! my lord, I have been strangely
      mistaken in you. Pembroke, you can now prove I was in error. You fold your
      arms&mdash;'tis well! I understand you. Rich, Huntingdon, Darcy, I appeal
      to you. My lords! my lords! you forget to whom you owe allegiance. Sir
      Thomas Cheney,&mdash;do you not hear me speak to you, Sir Thomas? Cecil,
      my politic, crafty Cecil,&mdash;a few strokes of your pen is all I ask,
      and those you refuse me. Gates, Petre, Cheke,&mdash;will none of you move?
      will none sign?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None," answered Pembroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false," cried Northumberland, imperiously; "you shall <i>all</i>
      sign,&mdash;<i>all!</i> vile, perjured traitors that you are! I will have
      your hands to this paper, or, by God's precious soul! I will seal it with
      your blood. Now, will you obey me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stern, deep silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you obey him?" demanded Renard, in a mocking whisper. "No!" answered
      Pembroke, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guards!" cried Northumberland, "advance, and attach their persons."
    </p>
    <p>
      The command was instantly obeyed by the arquebusiers, who marched forward
      and surrounded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane fixed an inquiring look upon Northumberland, but she spoke not.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What next?" demanded Pembroke, in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The block," replied Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The block!" exclaimed Jane, rising, while the colour forsook her cheek.
      "Oh! no, my lord,&mdash;no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I say yea," returned the Duke, peremptorily. "'Fore Heaven! these
      rebellious lords think I am as fearful of shedding blood as they are of
      shedding ink. But they shall find they are mistaken. Away with them to
      instant execution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace cannot mean this!" cried Jane, horror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall have five minutes for reflection," returned the Duke, sternly.
      "After that time, nothing shall save them.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      An earnest consultation was held among the council. Three minutes had
      expired. The Duke beckoned a sergeant of the guard towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better sign," whispered Simon Renard; "I will find some means of
      communicating with her highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have reflected," cried the Earl of Pembroke, "and will do your grace's
      behests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," answered Northumberland. "Set them free." As soon as the
      guard had withdrawn, the council advanced, and each, in turn, according to
      his degree, subscribed the despatch. This done, Northumberland delivered
      it to an officer, enjoining him to give it instantly to the messenger,
      with orders to the latter to ride for his life, and not to draw bridle
      till he reached Kenninghall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now," continued the Duke, addressing another officer, "let the gates
      of the Tower be closed, the drawbridges raised, and suffer none to go
      forth, on pain of death, without my written order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Diable!" exclaimed De Noailles, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prisoners!" cried several of the privy-councillors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the queen's guests, my lords," observed the Duke, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you agree to my scheme now?" asked Renard, in a deep whisper. "Do you
      consent to Northumberland's assassination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," replied Pembroke. "But who will strike the blow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will find the man," answered Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, though uttered under the breath of the speakers, reached the
      ears of Cuthbert Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards, the council broke up; and Jane was conducted with much
      state to the royal apartments.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>uthbert
      Cholmondeley, it may be remembered, was greatly struck by a beautiful
      damsel whom he discovered among the crowd during the ceremonial at the
      Gate Tower; and, as faithful chroniclers, we are bound to state that the
      impression was mutual, and that if he was charmed with the lady, she was
      not less pleased with him. Notwithstanding her downcast looks, the young
      esquire was not so inexperienced in feminine arts as to be unconscious of
      the conquest he had made. During the halt at the gate, he never withdrew
      his eyes from her for a single moment, and when he was reluctantly
      compelled to move forward with the procession, he cast many a lingering
      look behind. As the distance lengthened between them, the courage of the
      damsel seemed to revive; she raised her head, and before her admirer had
      reached the extremity of the lofty wall masking the lieutenant's lodgings,
      he perceived her gazing fixedly after him. She held by the hand a little
      curly-haired boy, whom Cholmondeley concluded must be her brother,&mdash;and
      he was perplexing himself as to her rank,&mdash;for though her beauty was
      of the highest order, and her lineaments such as might well belong to one
      of high birth, her attire seemed to bespeak her of no exalted condition,&mdash;when
      an incident occurred, which changed the tenor of his thoughts, and
      occasioned him not a little uneasiness. While she remained with her eyes
      fixed upon him, a tall man in a dark dress rushed, with furious gestures
      and an inflamed countenance, out of the gateway leading to the inner line
      of fortifications on the left, and shaking his hand menacingly at the
      esquire, forced her away. Cholmondeley saw her no more; but the imploring
      look which she threw at him as she disappeared, produced so powerful an
      effect upon his feelings that it was with difficulty he could prevent
      himself from flying to her assistance. So absorbed was he by this idea,
      that he could think of nothing else;&mdash;the pageant, at which he was
      assisting, lost all interest for him, and amid the throng of court
      beauties who surrounded him, he beheld only the tender blue eyes, the
      light satin tresses, the ravishing countenance, and sylph-like person of
      the unknown maiden. Nor could he exclude from his recollection the figure
      of the tall dark man; and he vainly questioned himself as to the tie
      subsisting between him and the damsel. Could he be her father?&mdash;Though
      his age might well allow of such a supposition, there was no family
      resemblance to warrant it. Her husband?&mdash;that he was scarcely
      disposed to admit. Her lover?&mdash;he trembled with jealous rage at the
      idea. In this perplexity, he bethought himself of applying for information
      to one of the warders; and, accordingly, he addressed himself to Magog,
      who, with Xit, happened to be standing near him. Describing the damsel, he
      inquired of the giant whether he knew anything of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know her!" rejoined Magog, "ay, marry, do I. Who that dwells within this
      fortress knows not fair Mistress Cicely, the Rose of the Tower, as she is
      called? She is daughter to Dame Prudentia Trusbut, wife of Peter the
      pantler&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cook's daughter!" exclaimed Cholmondeley, all his dreams of high-born
      beauty vanishing at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I ought rather to say," returned the giant, noticing the young mans
      look of blank disappointment, and guessing the cause, "that she <i>passes</i>
      for his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I breathe again," murmured Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her real birth is a mystery," continued Magog; "or, if the secret is
      known at all, it is only to the worthy pair who have adopted her. She is
      said to be the offspring of some illustrious and ill-fated lady, who was
      imprisoned within the Tower, and died in one of its dungeons, after giving
      birth to a female child, during the reign of our famous king, Harry the
      Eighth," and he reverently doffed his bonnet as he pronounced his sire's
      name; "but I know nothing of the truth or falsity of the story, and merely
      repeat it because you seem curious about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your intelligence delights me," replied Cholmondeley, placing a noble in
      his hand. "Can you bring me where I can obtain further sight of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and speech too, worshipful sir, if you desire it," replied the giant,
      a smile illuminating his ample features. "When the evening banquet is
      over, and my attendance at the palace is no longer required, I shall
      repair to the Stone Kitchen at Master Trusbut's dwelling, where a supper
      is provided for certain of the warders and other officers of the Tower, to
      which I and my brethren are invited, and if it please you to accompany us,
      you are almost certain to behold her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley eagerly embraced the offer, and it was next arranged that the
      dwarf should summon him at the proper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your worship requires a faithful emissary to convey a letter or token
      to the fair damsel," interposed Xit, "I will undertake the office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fail not to acquaint me when your master is ready," replied Cholmondeley,
      "and I will reward you. There is one question," he continued, addressing
      Magog, "which I have omitted to ask.&mdash;Who is the tall dark man who
      seems to exercise such strange control over her? Can it be her adoptive
      father, the pantier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a surety no," replied the giant, grinning, "Peter Trusbut is neither a
      tall man nor a dark; but is short, plump, and rosy, as beseems his office.
      The person to whom your worship alludes must be Master Lawrence Nightgall,
      the chief jailor, who lately paid his suit to her. He is of a jealous and
      revengeful temper, and is not unlikely to take it in dudgeon that a
      handsome gallant should set eyes upon the object of his affections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your description answers exactly to the man I mean," returned
      Cholmondeley, gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I bear a cartel to him from your worship?" said Xit. "Or, if you
      require a guard, I will attend upon your person," he added, tapping the
      pummel of his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not require your services in either capacity, as yet, valiant sir,"
      replied the esquire, smiling. "After the banquet I shall expect you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Resuming his place near Lord Guilford Dudley, Cholmondeley shortly
      afterwards proceeded with the royal cortege to the council-chamber, where,
      being deeply interested by Northumberland's address to the conspiring
      lords, he for an instant forgot the object nearest his heart. But the
      next, it returned with greater force than ever; and he was picturing to
      himself the surprise, and, as he fondly hoped, the delight, he should
      occasion her by presenting himself at her dwelling, when Simon Renard's
      dark proposal to the Earl of Pembroke reached his ear. Anxious to convey
      the important information he had thus obtained to his master, as soon as
      possible, he endeavoured to approach him, but at this moment the council
      broke up, and the whole train returned to the palace. During the banquet
      that followed, no opportunity for an instant's private conference occurred&mdash;the
      signal for the separation of the guests being the departure of the Queen
      and her consort. While he was considering within himself what course he
      had best pursue, he felt his mantle slightly plucked behind, and, turning
      at the touch, beheld the dwarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My master, the giant Magog, awaits you without, worshipful sir," said
      Xit, with a profound reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weighing his sense of duty against his love, he found the latter feeling
      too strong to be resisted. Contenting himself, therefore, with tracing a
      hasty lino of caution upon a leaf torn from his tablets, he secured it
      with a silken thread, and delivering it to an attendant, commanded him
      instantly to take it to the Lord Guilford Dudley. The man departed, and
      Cholmondelcy, putting himself under the guidance of the dwarf, followed
      him to the great stairs, down which he strutted with a most consequential
      air, his long rapier clanking at each step he took. Arrived at the portal,
      the young esquire found the three giants, who had just been relieved from
      further attendance by another detachment of warders, and, accompanied by
      them, proceeded along the ward in the direction of the Gate-Tower.
      Sentinels, he perceived, were placed at ten paces' distance from each
      other along the ramparts; and the guards on the turrets, he understood
      from his companions, were doubled. On reaching the Gate-Tower, they found
      a crowd of persons, some of whom, on presenting passes from the Duke of
      Northumberland, were allowed to go forth; while others, not thus provided,
      were peremptorily refused. While the giants paused for a moment to
      contemplate this novel scene, an officer advanced from the barbican and
      acquainted the keepers of the inner portal that a prisoner was about to be
      brought in. At this intelligence, a wicket was opened, and two heralds,
      followed by a band of halberdiers, amidst whom walked the prisoner,
      stepped through it. Torches were then lighted by some of the warders, to
      enable them to discern the features of the latter, when it appeared, from
      his ghastly looks, his blood-stained apparel, and his hair, which was
      closely matted to his head by the ruddy stream that flowed from it, that
      some severe punishment had been recently inflicted upon him. He was a
      young man of nineteen or twenty, habited in a coarse dress of brown serge,
      of a slight but well-proportioned figure, and handsome features, though
      now distorted with pain and sullied with blood, and was instantly
      recognised by Cholmondelcy as the individual who had rowed Gunnora Braose
      towards the Queen. On making the discovery, Cholmondeley instantly
      demanded, in a stern tone, of the heralds, how they had dared, in direct
      opposition to their sovereign's injunctions, to punish an offender whom
      she had pardoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have the Duke of Northumberland's authority for what we have done,"
      replied the foremost herald, sullenly; "that is sufficient for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The punishment we have inflicted is wholly disproportioned to the
      villain's offence, which is little short of high treason," observed the
      other. "When we proclaimed the Queen's Highness at Cheapside, the
      audacious knave mounted a wall, flung his cap into the air, and shouted
      for Queen Mary. For this we set him in the pillory, and nailed his head to
      the wood; and he may think himself fortunate if he loseth it not as well
      as his ears, which have been cut off by the hangman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ungrateful wretch!" cried Cholmondeley, addressing the prisoner, his
      former commiseration being now changed to anger; "is it thus you requite
      the bounty of your Queen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never acknowledge a usurper," returned Gilbert, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace!" cried the esquire; "your rashness will destroy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may so," retorted Gilbert, boldly; "but while I have a tongue to wag,
      it shall clamour for Queen Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going to bestow the prisoner?" inquired Gog from the
      foremost herald.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the guard-room," replied the man, "or some other place of security,
      till we learn his grace's pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring him to the Stone Kitchen, then," returned Gog. "He will be as safe
      there as anywhere else, and you will be none the worse for a can of good
      liquor, and a slice of one of Dame Trusbut's notable pasties.'"
    </p>
    <p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0053.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      "Agreed;" rejoined the heralds, smiling; "bring him along." While this was
      passing, Cholmondeley, whose impatience could brook no further delay,
      entreated Magog to conduct him at once to the habitation of the fair
      Cicely. Informing him that it was close at hand, the giant opened a small
      postern on the left of the gateway leading to the western line of
      fortifications, and ascending a short spiral staircase, ushered his
      companion into a chamber, which, to this day, retains its name of the
      Stone Kitchen. It was a low, large room, with the ceiling supported by
      heavy rafters, and the floor paved with stone. The walls were covered with
      shelves, displaying a goodly assortment of pewter and wooden platters,
      dishes and drinking-vessels; the fire-place was wide enough to admit of a
      whole ox being roasted within its limits; the chimney-piece advanced
      several yards into the room, while beneath its comfortable shelter were
      placed a couple of benches on either side of the hearth, on which a heap
      of logs was now crackling. Amid the pungent smoko arising from the wood
      could be discerned, through the vast aperture of the chimney, sundry hams,
      gammons, dried tongues, and other savoury meats, holding forth a prospect
      of future good cheer. At a table running across the room, and furnished
      with flagons and pots of wine, several boon companions were seated. The
      chief of these was a jovial-looking warder who appeared to be the life and
      soul of the party, and who had a laugh, a joke, or the snatch of a song,
      for every occasion. Opposite to him sat Peter Trusbut, the pantler, who
      roared at every fresh witticism uttered by his guest till the tears ran
      down his cheeks. Nor did the warder appear to be less of a favourite with
      Dame Potentia, a stout buxom personage, a little on the wrong side of
      fifty, but not without some remains of comeliness. She kept his glass
      constantly filled with the best wine, and his plate as constantly supplied
      with the choicest viands, so that, what with eating, drinking, singing,
      and a little sly love-making to Dame Trusbut, Pibald, for so was the
      warder named, was pretty well employed. At the lower end of the table was
      placed a savage-looking person, with red bloodshot eyes and a cadaverous
      countenance. This was Mauger, the headsman. He was engaged in earnest
      conversation with Master Hairun, the bearward, assistant-keeper of the
      lions,&mdash;an office, at that time, of some consequence and emolument.
      In the ingle nook was ensconced a venerable old man with a snowy beard
      descending to his knees, who remained with his eyes fixed vacantly upon
      the blazing embers. Seated on a stool near the hearth, was a little boy
      playing with a dog, whom Cholmondeley perceived at once was Cicely's
      companion; while the adjoining chair was occupied by the fair creature of
      whom the enamoured esquire was in search. Pausing at the doorway, he
      lingered for a moment to contemplate her charms. A slight shade of sadness
      clouded her brow&mdash;her eyes were fixed upon the ground, and she now
      and then uttered a half-repressed sigh. At this juncture, the
      jolly-looking warder struck up a Bacchanalian stave, the words of which
      ran as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With my back to the fire and my paunch to the table,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Let me eat,&mdash;let me drink as long as I am able:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Let me eat,&mdash;let me drink whate'er I set my whims on,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Until my nose is blue, and my jolly visage crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The doctor preaches abstinence, and threatens me with dropsy,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But such advice, I needn't say, from drinking never stops ye:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The man who likes good liquor is of nature brisk and brave, boys,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So drink away!&mdash;drink while you may!&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There's no drinking in the grave, boys!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      "Well sung, my roystering Pibald," cried Magog, striding up to him, and
      delivering him a sounding blow on the back&mdash;"thou art ever merry, and
      hast the most melodious voice and the lustiest lungs of any man within the
      Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And thou hast the heaviest hand I ever felt on my shoulder, gigantic
      Magog," replied Ribald; "so we are even. But come, pledge me in a brimmer,
      and we will toss off a lusty measure to the health of our sovereign lady,
      Queen Jane. What say you, Master Trusbut?&mdash;and you, good Hairun&mdash;and
      you, most melancholic Mauger, a cup of claret will bring the colour to
      your cheeks. A pot of wine, good dame, to drink the Queen's health in. But
      whom have we yonder? Is that gallant thy companion, redoubted Magog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The giant nodded an affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith he is a well-looking youth," said Ribald&mdash;"but he seems
      to have eyes for no one excepting fair Mistress Cicely."

      Aroused by this remark, the young damsel looked up and beheld the
      passionate gaze of Cholmondeley fixed upon her. She started, trembled, and
      endeavoured to hide her confusion by industriously pursuing her occupation
      of netting. But in spite of her efforts to restrain herself, she could not
      help stealing a sidelong glance at him; and emboldened by this slight
      encouragement, Cholmondeley ventured to advance towards her. It is
      scarcely necessary to detail the common-place gallantries which the youth
      addressed to her, or the monosyllabic answers which she returned to them.
      The language of love is best expressed by the look which accompanies the
      word, and the tone in which that word is uttered; and this language,
      though as yet neither party was much skilled in it, appeared perfectly
      intelligible to both of them. Satisfied, at length, that she was not
      insensible to his suit, Cholmondeley drew nearer, and bending his head
      towards her, poured the most passionate protestations in her ear. What
      answer she made, if she made answer at all to these ardent addresses, we
      know not, but her heightened complexion and heaving bosom told that she
      was by no means insensible to them. Meanwhile, Og and Gog, together with
      the heralds and one or two men-at-arms, had entered the chamber with the
      prisoner. Much bustle ensued, and Dame Potcntia was so much occupied with
      the new-comers and their wants, that she had little time to bestow upon
      her adoptive daughter. It is true that she thought the handsome stranger
      more attentive than was needful, or than she judged discreet; and she
      determined to take the earliest opportunity of putting a stop to the
      flirtation&mdash;but, just then, it happened that her hands were too full
      to allow her to attend to minor matters. As to Peter Trusbut, he was so
      much entertained with the pleasantries of his friend Ribald&mdash;and so
      full of the banquet he had provided for the Queen, the principal dishes of
      which he recapitulated for the benefit of his guests, that he saw nothing
      whatever that was passing between the young couple. Not so a
      gloomy-looking personage shrouded behind the angle of the chimney, who,
      with his hand upon his dagger, bent eagerly forward to catch their
      lightest whisper. Two other mysterious individuals had also entered the
      room, and stationed themselves near the doorway. As soon as Dame Trusbut
      had provided for the wants of her numerous guests, she turned her
      attention to the prisoner, who had excited her compassion, and who sat
      with his arms folded upon his breast, preserving the same resolute
      demeanour he had maintained throughout. Proffering her services to the
      sufferer, she bade her attendant, Agatha, bring a bowl of water to bathe
      his wounds, and a fold of linen to bind round his head. At this moment,
      Xit, the dwarf, who was by no means pleased with the unimportant part he
      was compelled to play, bethought him of an expedient to attract attention.
      Borrowing from the herald the scroll of the proclamation, he mounted upon
      Og's shoulders, and begged him to convey him to the centre of the room,
      that he might read it aloud to the assemblage, and approve their loyalty.
      The good-humoured giant complied. Supporting the mannikin with his left
      hand, and placing his large two-handed sword over his right shoulder, he
      walked forward, while the dwarf screamed forth the following preamble to
      the proclamation:&mdash;"<i>Jane, by the grace of God Queen of England,
      France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, and of the Church of England,
      and also of Ireland, under Christ on earth the supreme head. To all our
      loving, faithful, and obedients, and to every of them, greeting.</i>" Here
      he paused to shout and wave his cap, while the herald, who had followed
      them, to humour the joke raised his embroidered trumpet to his lips, and
      blew a blast so loud and shrill, that the very rafters shook with it. To
      this clamour Og added his stunning laughter, while his brethren, who were
      leaning over a screen behind, and highly diverted with the incident,
      joined in lusty chorus. Almost deafened by the noise, Dame Trusbut, by way
      of putting an end to it, raised her own voice to its utmost pitch, and
      threatened to turn Xit, whom she looked upon as the principal cause of the
      disturbance, out of the house. Unfortunately, in her anger, she forgot
      that she was engaged in dressing the prisoner's wounds, and while her left
      hand was shaken menacingly at the dwarf, her right convulsively grasped
      the poor fellow's head, occasioning him such exquisite pain, that he added
      his outcries to the general uproar. The more Dame Trusbut scolded, the
      more Og and his brethren laughed, and the louder the herald blew his
      trumpet&mdash;so that it seemed as if there was no likelihood of
      tranquillity being speedily restored&mdash;nor, in all probability would
      it have been so without the ejectment of the dwarf, had it not been for
      the interference of Ribald, who at length, partly by cajolery, and partly
      by coercion, succeeded in pacifying the angry dame. During this tumult,
      the two mysterious personages, who, it has been stated, had planted
      themselves at the doorway, approached the young couple unobserved, and one
      of them, after narrowly observing the features of the young man, observed
      in an under-tone to his companion, "It <i>is</i> Cuthbert Cholmondeley&mdash;You
      doubted me, my lord Pembroke, but I was assured it was Lord Guilford's
      favourite esquire, who had conveyed the note to his master, warning him of
      our scheme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, M. Simon Renard," replied the earl. "I bow to your
      superior discernment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The young man is in possession of our secret," rejoined Renard, "and
      though we have intercepted the missive, he may yet betray us. He must not
      return to the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He never <i>shall</i> return, my lords," said a tall dark man, advancing
      towards them, "if you will entrust his detention to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" demanded Renard, eyeing him suspiciously. "Lawrence
      Nightgall, the chief jailor of the Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your motive for this offer?" pursued Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look there!" returned Nightgall. "I love that damsel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see;" replied Renard, smiling bitterly. "He has supplanted you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has," rejoined Nightgall; "but he shall not live to profit by his good
      fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!" said Renard, glancing at Cicely, "the damsel is lovely enough to
      ruin a man's soul. We will trust you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow me, then, without, my lords," replied Nightgall, "and I will
      convey him where he shall not cause further uneasiness to any of us. We
      have dungeons within the Tower, from which those who enter them seldom
      return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are acquainted, no doubt, with the secret passages of the White
      Tower, friend?" asked Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all of them," rejoined Nightgall. "I know every subterranean
      communication&mdash;every labyrinth&mdash;every hidden recess within the
      walls of the fortress, and there are many such&mdash;and can conduct you
      wherever you desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the very man I want," cried Renard, rubbing his hands, gleefully.
      "Lead on."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the trio quitted the chamber, without their departure being noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour afterwards, as Cuthbert Cholmondeley issued from the postern
      with a heart elate with rapture at having elicited from the fair Cicely a
      confession that she loved him, he received a severe blow on the head from
      behind, and before he could utter a single outcry, he was gagged, and
      forced away by his assailants.

    <h2>
      IV.&mdash;OF THE MYSTERIOUS OCCURRENCE THAT HAPPENED TO QUEEN JANE IN
      SAINT JOHN'S CHAPEL IN THE WHITE TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n that night Lord
      Guilford Dudley was summoned to a secret council by his father, the Duke
      of Northumberland, and as he had not returned at midnight, the Lady
      Hastings, who was in attendance upon the Queen, proposed that, to while
      away the time, they should pay a visit to St. John's Chapel in the White
      Tower, of the extreme beauty of which they had all heard, though none of
      them had seen it. Jane assented to the proposal, and accompanied by her
      sister, the Lady Herbert, and the planner of the expedition, Lady
      Hastings, she set forth. Two ushers led the way through the long galleries
      and passages which had to be traversed before they reached the White
      Tower; but on arriving at the room adjoining the council-chamber which had
      so lately been thronged with armed men, but which was now utterly
      deserted, Jane inquired from her attendants the way to the chapel, and on
      ascertaining it, commanded her little train to await her return there, as
      she had determined on entering the sacred structure alone. In vain her
      sisters remonstrated with her&mdash;in vain the ushers suggested that
      there might be danger in trusting herself in such a place at such an hour
      without protection&mdash;she remained firm&mdash;but promised to return in
      a few minutes, after which they could explore the chapel together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a lamp from one of the attendants, and pursuing the course pointed
      out to her, she threaded a narrow passage, similar to that she had
      traversed with the Duke in the morning, and speedily entered upon the
      gallery above the chapel. As she passed through the opening in the wall
      leading to this gallery, she fancied she beheld the retreating figure of a
      man, muffled in a cloak, and she paused for a moment, half-inclined to
      turn back. Ashamed, however, of her irresolution, and satisfied that it
      was a mere trick of the imagination, she walked on. Descending a short
      spiral wooden staircase, she found herself within one of the aisles of the
      chapel, and passing between its columns, entered the body of the fane. For
      some time, she was lost in admiration of this beautiful structure, which,
      in its style of architecture&mdash;the purest Norman&mdash;is without an
      equal. She counted its twelve massive and circular stone pillars, noted
      their various ornaments and mouldings, and admired their grandeur and
      simplicity. Returning to the northern aisle, she glanced at its vaulted
      roof, and was enraptured at the beautiful effect produced by the
      interweaving arches.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was thus occupied, she again fancied she beheld the same muffled
      figure she had before seen, glide behind one of the pillars. Seriously
      alarmed, she was now about to retrace her steps, when her eye rested upon
      an object lying at a little distance from her, on the ground. Prompted by
      an undefinable feeling of curiosity, she hastened towards it, and holding
      forward the light, a shudder ran through her frame, as she perceived at
      her feet, <i>an axe!</i> It was the peculiarly-formed implement used by
      the headsman, and the edge was turned towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, her lamp was extinguished.

    <p>
      NOT appearing, and some time having elapsed since her departure, her
      sisters, who were anxiously awaiting her return in the room adjoining the
      council-chamber, became so uneasy, that, notwithstanding her injunctions
      to the contrary, they resolved to go in search of her. Accordingly,
      bidding the ushers precede them, they descended to the chapel; and their
      uneasiness was by no means decreased on finding it buried in darkness, and
      apparently empty. As they gazed around in perplexity and astonishment, a
      deep-drawn sigh broke from the northern aisle; and, hurrying in that
      direction, they discovered the object of their search, who had been hidden
      from view by the massive intervening pillars, extended upon a seat, and
      just recovering from a swoon into which she had fallen. Revived by their
      assiduities, Jane was soon able to speak, and the first thing she uttered
      was a peremptory order that no alarm should be given, or assistance sent
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am now well&mdash;quite well," she said, with a look and in a tone that
      belied her words, "and require no further aid. Do not question me as to
      what has happened. My brain is too confused to think of it; and I would
      fain banish it altogether from my memory. Moreover, I charge you by your
      love and allegiance, that you mention to no one&mdash;not even to my dear
      lord and husband, should he interrogate you on the subject,&mdash;how you
      have just found me. And if my visit here be not remarked by him&mdash;as
      is not unlikely, if he should remain closeted with the Duke of
      Northumberland,&mdash;it is my will and pleasure that no allusion be made
      to the circumstance. You will not need to be told, dear sisters, that I
      have good reasons for thus imposing silence upon you. To you, sirs," she
      continued, addressing the ushers, who listened to her with the greatest
      surprise, "I also enjoin the strictest secrecy;&mdash;and look well you
      observe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The solemn and mysterious manner in which the Queen delivered her commands
      quite confounded her sisters, who glanced at each other as if they knew
      not what to think;&mdash;but they readily promised compliance, as did the
      ushers. Supporting herself on the arm of Lady Herbert, Jane then arose,
      and proceeded at a slow pace towards the eastern stair-case. As she was
      about to turn the corner of the aisle, she whispered to Lady Hastings, who
      walked on her left&mdash;"Look behind you, Catherine. Do you see nothing
      on the ground?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever, your highness," replied the other, glancing fearfully
      over her shoulder. "Nothing whatever, except the black and fantastic
      shadows of our attendants."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank Heaven! it is gone," ejaculated Jane, as if relieved from a weight
      of anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is gone, dear sister?" inquired Lady Herbert, affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not ask me," replied Jane, in a tone calculated to put an end to
      further conversation on the subject. "What I have seen and heard must for
      ever remain locked in my own bosom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I begin to think a spirit must have appeared to your majesty," observed
      Lady Herbert, whose curiosity was violently excited, and who, in common
      with most persons of the period, entertained a firm belief in supernatural
      appearances. "Every chamber in the Tower is said to be haunted,&mdash;and
      why not this ghostly chapel, which looks as if it were peopled with
      phantoms? I am quite sorry I proposed to visit it. But if I am ever caught
      in it again, except in broad daylight, and then only with sufficient
      attendance, your majesty shall have free leave to send me to keep company
      with the invisible world for the future. I would give something to know
      what you have seen. Perhaps it was the ghost of Anne Boleyn, who is known
      to walk;&mdash;or the guilty Catherine Howard,&mdash;or the old Countess
      of Salisbury. Do tell me which it was&mdash;and whether the spectre
      carried its head under its arm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this," said Jane, authoritatively. "Come with me to the
      altar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty is not going to remain here?" cried Lady Hastings. "I
      declare positively <i>I</i> dare not stop."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not detain you longer than will suffice to offer a single prayer
      to Heaven," rejoined the Queen. "Be not afraid. Nothing will injure, or
      affright you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am by no means sure of that," replied Lady Hastings. "And now I really
      <i>do</i> think I see something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" exclaimed Jane, starting. "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behind the farthest pillar on the right," replied Lady Hastings, pointing
      towards it. "It looks like a man muffled in a cloak. There!&mdash;it
      moves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and see whether any one be lurking in the chapel," said Jane to the
      nearest usher, and speaking in a voice so loud, that it almost seemed as
      if she desired to be overheard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant obeyed; and immediately returned with the intelligence that
      he could find no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your fears, you perceive, are groundless, Catherine," observed Jane,
      forcing a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not altogether, I am persuaded, from your manner, my dear sister, and
      gracious mistress," rejoined Lady Hastings. "Oh! how I wish I was safe
      back again in the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I," added Lady Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A moment's patience and I am ready," rejoined Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, she approached the altar, and prostrated herself on the velvet
      cushion before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almighty Providence!" she murmured in a tone so low as to be inaudible to
      the others, "I humbly petition thee and supplicate thee, that if the
      kingdom that has been given me be rightly and lawfully mine, thou wilt
      grant me so much grace and spirit, that I may govern it to thy glory,
      service, and advantage. But if it be otherwise&mdash;if I am unlawfully
      possessed of it, and am an hindrance to one who might serve thee more
      effectually, remove, O Lord, the crown from my head, and set it on that of
      thy chosen servant! And if what I have this night beheld be a
      fore-shadowing and a warning of the dreadful doom that awaits me, grant
      me, I beseech thee, strength to meet it with fortitude and resignation; so
      that my ending, like my life, may redound to thy honour, and the welfare
      of thy holy church." While Jane was thus devoutly occupied, her sisters,
      who stood behind her, could scarcely control their uneasiness, but glanced
      ever and anon timorously round, as if in expectation of some fearful
      interruption. Their fears were speedily communicated to the ushers; and
      though nothing occurred to occasion fresh alarm, the few minutes spent by
      the Queen in prayer appeared an age to her companions. There was something
      in the hour&mdash;it was past midnight,&mdash;and the place, calculated to
      awaken superstitious terrors. The lights borne by the attendants only
      illumined a portion of the chapel; rendering that which was left in shadow
      yet more sombre; while the columned aisles on either side, and the
      deeply-recessed arches of the gallery above, were shrouded in gloom. Even
      in broad day, St. John's Chapel is a solemn and a striking spot; but at
      midnight, with its heavy, hoary pillars, reared around like phantoms, its
      effect upon the imagination will be readily conceived to be far greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already described as one of the most perfect specimens of Norman
      ecclesiastical architecture, this venerable structure, once used as a
      place of private worship by the old monarchs of England, and now as a
      receptacle for Chancery proceedings, has, from its situation in the heart
      of the White Tower, preserved, in an almost unequalled state, its original
      freshness and beauty; and, except that its floors are encumbered with
      cases, and its walls of Caen stone disfigured by a thick coat of white
      plaster, it is now much in the same state that it was at the period under
      consideration. It consists of a nave with broad aisles, flanked (as has
      been mentioned) by twelve circular pillars, of the simplest and most solid
      construction, which support a stone gallery of equal width with the
      aisles, and having an arcade corresponding with that beneath the floor is
      now boarded, but was formerly covered with a hard polished cement,
      resembling red granite. The roof is coved, and beautifully proportioned;
      and the fane is completed by a semicircular termination towards the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Stowe records the following order, given in the reign of Henry the
      Third, for its decoration:&mdash;"And that ye cause the whole chapel of
      St. John the Evangelist to be whited. And that ye cause three glass
      windows in the same chapel to be made; to wit, one on the north side, with
      a certain little Mary holding her child; the other on the south part, with
      the image of the Trinity; and the third, of St. John the Apostle and
      Evangelist, in the south part. And that ye cause the cross and the beam
      beyond the altar of the same chapel to be painted well and with good
      colours. And that ye cause to be made and painted two fair images where
      more conveniently and decently they may be done in the same chapel; one of
      St. Edward, holding a ring, and reaching it out to St. John the
      Evangelist." These fair images&mdash;the cross&mdash;the rood,&mdash;and
      the splendid illuminated window, are gone&mdash;most of them, indeed, were
      gone in Queen Jane's time&mdash;the royal worshippers are gone with them;
      but enough remains in its noble arcades, its vaulted aisles, and matchless
      columns, to place St. John's Chapel foremost in beauty of its class of
      architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her devotions over, Jane arose with a lighter heart, and, accompanied by
      her little train, quitted the chapel. On reaching her own apartments, she
      dismissed her attendants, with renewed injunctions of secrecy; and as Lord
      Guilford Dudley had not returned from the council, and she felt too much
      disturbed in mind to think of repose, she took from among the books on her
      table, a volume of the divine Plato, whose Phædo, in the original tongue,
      she was wont, in the words of her famous instructor, Roger Ascham, "to
      read with as much delight as some gentlemen would take in a merry tale of
      Boccace," and was speedily lost in his profound and philosophic
      speculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the greater part of the night was consumed; nor was it till
      near day-break that she was aroused from her studies by the entrance of'
      her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, my beloved queen!" he exclaimed, hastening towards her with a
      countenance beaming with delight. "I have intelligence for you which will
      enchant you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! my dear lord,"' she replied, laying down her book, and rising to
      meet him. "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guess," he answered, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, dear Dudley," she rejoined, "put me not to this trouble. Tell me at
      once your news, that I may participate in your satisfaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a word, then, my queen," replied Lord Guilford,&mdash;"My father and
      the nobles propose to elevate me to the same dignity as yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's countenance fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They have not the power to do so, my lord," she rejoined gravely; "I,
      alone, can thus elevate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I am king," cried Dudley, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," observed Jane, with increased gravity, "you will pardon me if I
      say I must consider of this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Consider of it!" echoed her husband, frowning; "I must have your decision
      at once. You can have no hesitation, since my father desires it. I am your
      husband, and claim your obedience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, my lord," rejoined Jane, with dignity, "am your queen; and, as
      such, it is for me, not you, to exact obedience. We will talk no further
      on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, madam," replied Lord Guilford, coldly. "To-morrow you will
      learn the Duke's pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I do so, he shall know mine," rejoined Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is this?" exclaimed Dudley, gazing at her in astonishment. "Can it be
      possible you are the same Jane whom I left&mdash;all love&mdash;all
      meekness&mdash;all compliance?&mdash;or have a few hours of rule so
      changed your nature, that you no longer love me as heretofore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley," returned Jane, tenderly, "you are dear to me as ever; and if I
      accede not to your wishes, do not impute it to other than the right
      motive. As a queen, I have duties paramount to all other considerations,&mdash;duties
      which, so long as I <i>am</i> queen, I will fulfil to the best of my
      ability, and at every personal sacrifice. Be not wholly guided by the
      counsels of your father,&mdash;be not dazzled by ambition. The step you
      propose is fraught with danger. It may cost me my crown, and cannot ensure
      one to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," replied her husband, apparently convinced by her arguments. "We
      will postpone its further consideration till to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      When that morrow came, Dudley's first business was to seek his father, and
      acquaint him with the manner in which his communication to the Queen had
      been received. The haughty Duke appeared surprised, but imputed the
      failure to his son's mismanagement, and undertook to set it right. With
      this view, he repaired to the Queen's apartments, and on obtaining an
      audience, informed her that he and the lords of the council had resolved
      to place her husband on the throne beside her. Her answer differed in
      nothing from that which she had returned to Lord Guilford, except that it
      was couched in a firmer tone; but it had this addition, that she was well
      aware of his Grace's object in the proposal, which was, in effect, to
      obtain possession of the supreme power. In vain arguments, entreaties, and
      even threats, were used by the Duke: Jane continued inflexible.
      Northumberland was succeeded by his no less imperious spouse, who, with
      all the insolence of her arrogant nature, rated her daughter-in-law
      soundly, and strove to terrify her into compliance. But she, too, failed;
      and Lord Guilford was so enraged at his consort's obstinacy, that he
      quitted the Tower, and departed for Sion House, without even taking leave
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexed as he felt by Jane's conduct, Northumberland was too well versed
      in human nature not to be aware that a character however soft and pliant
      may, by the sudden alteration of circumstances, be totally changed,&mdash;but
      he was by no means prepared for such a remarkable display of firmness as
      Jane had exhibited. The more he considered the matter, the more satisfied
      he became that she had some secret counsellor, under whose guidance she
      acted, and with the view of finding out who it was, he resolved to have
      all her motions watched. No one appeared so well fitted to this office as
      his daughter, the Lady Hastings; and sending for her, he extracted from
      her, in the course of conversation, all particulars with which she was
      acquainted of the mysterious occurrence in St. John's Chapel. This
      information filled Northumberland with new surprise, and convinced him
      that he had more to dread than he at first imagined, and that the schemes
      of his enemies must be in full operation. His suspicions fell upon Simon
      Renard, though he scarcely knew how to connect him with this particular
      occurrence. Dismissing his daughter with full instructions for the part he
      desired her to play, he continued for some time brooding over the mystery,
      and vainly trying to unravel it. At one time, he resolved to interrogate
      Jane; but the reception he had recently experienced, induced him to adopt
      a different and more cautious course. His thoughts, however, were soon
      diverted from the subject, by the onerous duties that pressed upon him.
      Amongst other distractions, not the least was the arrival of a messenger
      with the intelligence that Mary had retired from Kenninghall in Norfolk,
      whither he had despatched a body of men to surprise her, and retreated to
      a more secure post, Framlingham Castle&mdash;that she had been proclaimed
      in Norwich&mdash;and that her party was hourly gaining strength in all
      quarters. Ill news seldom comes alone, and the proud Duke experienced the
      truth of the adage. Other messengers brought word that the Earls of Bath,
      Sussex, and Oxford, Lord Wentworth, Sir Thomas Cornwallis, Sir Henry
      Jerningham, and other important personages, had declared themselves in her
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was debating upon the best means of crushing this danger in the
      bud, a page from Lady Hastings suddenly presented himself, and informed
      him that the Queen was at that moment engaged in deep conference with M.
      Simon Renard, in St. Peter's Chapel. On inquiry, the Duke learned that
      Jane, who had been greatly disturbed in mind since her husband's
      departure, had proceeded to St. Peter's Chapel&mdash;(a place of worship
      situated at the north end of the Tower Green, and appropriated to the
      public devotions of the court and household,)&mdash;accompanied by her
      mother, the Duchess of Suffolk, and her sisters, the Ladies Herbert and
      Hastings; and that the train had been joined by the Earls of Pembroke and
      Arundel, De Noailles, and Simon Renard&mdash;the latter of whom, when the
      Queen's devotions were ended, had joined her. Tarrying for no further
      information, the Duke summoned his attendants, and hastened to the Tower
      Green. Entering the chapel, he found the information he had received was
      correct. The wily ambassador was standing with the Queen before the altar.

      VI.&mdash;OF THE SOLEMN EXHORTATION PRONOUNCED TO THE GIANTS BY MASTER
      EDWARD UNDERHILL, THE "HOT-GOSPELLER," AT THEIR LODGING IN THE BY-WARD
      TOWER; AND OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED THEREBY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n spite of the
      interruption occasioned by the dwarf, the evening at the Stone Kitchen
      passed off pleasantly enough. Dame Potentia was restored to good humour by
      the attentions of the jovial warder, and the giants in consequence were
      regaled with an excellent and plentiful supper, of which Xit was permitted
      to partake. Whether it was that their long fasting, or their attendance at
      the state-banquet, had sharpened the appetites of the three gigantic
      brethren, or that the viands set before them were of a more tempting
      nature than ordinary, we pretend not to say, but certain it is that their
      prodigious performances at the table excited astonishment from all who
      witnessed them, and elicited the particular approbation of Ribald, who,
      being curious to ascertain how much they <i>could</i> eat, insisted on
      helping them to everything on the board, and, strange to say, met with no
      refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the profuse hospitality of the period, all the superfluities of the
      royal feast were placed at the disposal of the household; and it may
      therefore be conceived that Peter Trusbut's table was by no means scantily
      furnished. Nor was he disposed to stint his guests. Several small dishes
      which had been set before them having disappeared with marvellous
      celerity, he called for the remains of a lordly baron of beef, which had
      recently graced the royal sideboard. At the sight of this noble joint, Og,
      who had just appropriated a dish of roast quails, two of which he
      despatched at a mouthful, uttered a grunt of intense satisfaction, and
      abandoning the trifling dainties to Xit, prepared for the more substantial
      fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming the part of carver, Peter Trusbut sliced off huge wedges of the
      meat, and heaped the platters of the giants with more than would have
      satisfied men of ordinary appetites. But this did not satisfy them. They
      came again and again. The meat was of such admirable quality&mdash;so well
      roasted&mdash;so full of gravy, and the fat was so exquisite, that they
      could not sufficiently praise it, nor do it sufficient justice. The knife
      was never out of Peter Trusbut's hands; nor was he allowed to remain idle
      a moment. Scarcely had he helped Og, when Gog's plate was empty; and
      before Gog had got his allowance, Magog was bellowing for more. And so it
      continued as long as a fragment remained upon the bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puffing with the exertion he had undergone, the pantler then sat down,
      while Ribald, resolved not to be balked of his pastime, entreated Dame
      Potentia to let her guests wash down their food with a measure of
      metheglin. After some little solicitation, she complied, and returned with
      a capacious jug containing about three gallons of the balmy drink. The jug
      was first presented to Magog. Raising it to his lips, he took a long and
      stout pull, and then passed it to Gog, who detained it some seconds, drew
      a long breath, and returned it to Dame Trusbut, perfectly empty. By dint
      of fresh entreaties from the warder, Dame Potentia was once more induced
      to seek the cellar; and, on receiving the jug, Og took care to leave
      little in it for his brethren, but poured out what was left into a beaker
      for Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now literally "giants refreshed;" and Peter Trusbut, perceiving
      that they still cast wistful glances towards the larder, complied with a
      significant wink from Ribald, and went in search of further provisions.
      This time he brought the better half of a calvered salmon, a knuckle of
      Westphalia ham, a venison pasty with a castellated crust of goodly
      dimensions, a larded capon, and the legs and carcass of a peacock,
      decorated with a few feathers from the tail of that gorgeous bird. Magog,
      before whom the latter dainty was placed, turned up his nose at it, and
      giving it to Xit, vigorously assaulted the venison pasty. It soon became
      evident that the board would again be speedily cleared; and though he had
      no intention of playing the niggardly host on the present occasion, Peter
      Trusbut declared that this was the last time such valiant trenchermen
      should ever feed at his cost. But his displeasure was quickly dispelled by
      the mirth of the warder, who laughed him out of his resolution, and
      encouraged the giants to proceed by every means in his power. Og was the
      first to give in. Throwing back his huge frame on the bench, he seized a
      flask of wine that stood near him, emptied it into a flagon, tossed it off
      at a draught, and declared he had had enough. Gog soon followed his
      example. But Magog seemed insatiable, and continued actively engaged, to
      the infinite diversion of Ribald, and the rest of the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one person to whom this festive scene afforded no amusement.
      This was the fair Cicely. After Cholmondeley's departure&mdash;though
      wholly unacquainted with what had befallen him&mdash;she lost all her
      sprightliness, and could not summon up a smile, though she blushed deeply
      when rallied by the warder. In surrendering her heart at the first summons
      of the enamoured esquire, Cicely had obeyed an uncontrollable impulse; but
      she was by no means satisfied with herself for her precipitancy. She felt
      that she ought to have resisted rather than have yielded to a passion
      which, she feared, could have no happy result; and though her admirer had
      vowed eternal constancy, and pleaded his cause with all the eloquence and
      fervour of deep and sincere devotion&mdash;an eloquence which seldom falls
      ineffectually on female ears&mdash;she was not so unacquainted with the
      ways of the world as to place entire faith in his professions. But it was
      now too late to recede. Her heart was no longer her own; and if her lover
      had deceived her, and feigned a passion which he did not feel, she had no
      help for it, but to love on unrequited.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her bosom alternately fluttered with hope, or palpitated with fear,
      and her hands mechanically pursued their employment, she chanced to raise
      her eyes, and beheld the sinister gaze of Lawrence Nightgall fixed upon
      her. There was something in his malignant look that convinced her he read
      what was passing in her breast&mdash;and there was a bitter and exulting
      smile on his lip which, while it alarmed her on her account, terrified her
      (she knew not why) for her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are thinking of the young esquire who left you an hour ago," he
      observed sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not attempt to deny it," replied Cicely, colouring; "I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it," rejoined the jailer; "and he dared to tell you he loved you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you?&mdash;what answer did you give him, mistress?" continued
      Nightgall, furiously grasping her arm. "What answer did you give him, I
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me go," cried Cicely. "You hurt me dreadfully. I will not be
      questioned thus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I overheard what you said to him," rejoined the jailer. "You told him
      that you loved him&mdash;that you had loved no other&mdash;and would wed
      no other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told him the truth," exclaimed Cicely. "I do love him, and will wed
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false," cried Nightgall, laughing maliciously. "You will never see
      him again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How know you that?" she cried, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has left the Tower&mdash;for ever," returned the jailer, moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" cried Cicely. "The Duke of Northumberland has given orders
      that no one shall go forth without a pass. Besides, he told me he was
      returning to the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you he is gone," thundered Nightgall. "Hear me, Cicely," he
      continued, passionately. "I have loved you long&mdash;desperately. I would
      give my life&mdash;my soul for you. Do not cast me aside for this vain
      court-gallant, who pursues you only to undo you. He would never wed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has sworn to do so," replied Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" cried Nightgall, grinding his teeth, "The oath will never be
      kept. Cicely, you must&mdash;you <i>shall</i> be mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" replied the maiden. "Do you suppose I would unite myself to one
      whom I hate, as I do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hate me!" cried the jailer, grasping her arm with such force that she
      screamed with pain. "Do you dare to tell me so to my face?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," she rejoined. "Release me, monster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Body of my father! what's the matter?" roared Magog, who was sitting near
      them. "Leave go your hold of the damsel, Master Nightgall," he added,
      laying down his knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at your bidding, you overgrown ox!" replied the jailer. "We'll see
      that," replied the giant. And stretching out his hand, he seized him by
      the nape of the neck, and drew him forcibly backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall bleed for this, caitiff!" exclaimed Nightgall, disengaging
      himself, and menacing him with his poniard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush!" rejoined Magog, contemptuously, and instantly disarming him. "Your
      puny weapon will serve me for a toothpick," he added, suiting the action
      to the word. And, amid the loud laughter of the assemblage, the jailer
      slunk away, muttering interjections of rage and vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall's dark hints respecting Cholmondeley were not without effect
      upon Cicely, who, well aware of his fierce and revengeful character, could
      not help fearing some evil; and when he quitted the Stone Kitchen, an
      undefinable impulse prompted her to follow him. Hastily descending the
      stairs, on gaining the postern she descried him hurrying along the road
      between the ballium wall and the external line of fortifications, and
      instantly decided on following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the projecting walls of the Beauchamp Tower, behind which she
      sheltered herself, she saw that he stopped midway between that
      fortification and the next turret, then known as the Devilin, or Robin the
      Devil's Tower, but more recently, from having been the prison of the
      unfortunate Earl of Essex, as the Devereux Tower. Here he disappeared.
      Hastening to the spot, Cicely looked for the door, through which he must
      have passed; and after some little search, discovered it. Pushing against
      it, it yielded to the pressure, and admitted her to a low passage,
      evidently communicating with some of the subterranean dungeons which she
      knew existed under this part of the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely set foot within this passage, when she perceived the
      jailor returning; and had barely time to conceal herself behind an angle
      of the wall, when he approached the spot where she stood. In his haste he
      had forgotten to lock the door, and he now, with muttered execrations,
      hastened to repair his error; cutting off by this means the possibility of
      Cicely's retreat. And here, for the present, it will be necessary to leave
      her, and return to the Stone Kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attention which must otherwise have been infallibly called to Cicely's
      disappearance was diverted by the sudden entrance of a very singular
      personage, whose presence served somewhat to damp the hilarity of the
      party. This was Master Edward Underhill&mdash;a man of some ability, but
      of violent religious opinions, who, having recently been converted to the
      new doctrines, became so zealous in their support and propagation, that he
      obtained among his companions the nick-name of the "Hot-gospeller." He was
      a tall thin man, with sandy hair, and a scanty beard of the same colour.
      His eyes were blear and glassy, with pink lids utterly devoid of lashes,
      and he had a long lantern-shaped visage. His attire was that of a
      gentleman-pensioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebuking the assemblage for their unseemly mirth, and mounting upon a
      stool, Master Underhill would fain have compelled them to listen to a
      discourse on the necessity of extirpating papacy and idolatry from the
      land&mdash;but he was compelled, by the clamour which his exordium
      occasioned, to desist. He was, moreover, brought down, with undue
      precipitation, from his exalted position by Xit, who creeping under the
      stool, contrived to overset it, and prostrated the Gospeller on the floor,
      to the infinite entertainment of the guests, and the no small damage of
      his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      This incident, though received in good part even by the principal
      sufferer, served to break up the party. Apprehensive of some further
      disturbance, and not without fears that the giants might indulge as freely
      with the fluids as they had done with the solids, Dame Trusbut took
      advantage of the occurrence to dismiss her guests, which she did without
      much ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then for the first time that she noticed the absence of Cicely. Not
      being able to find her, the recollection of the handsome esquire, and of
      the attention he had paid her, rushed to her mind; and with a dreadful
      foreboding of impending misery, she despatched her husband to the palace
      to make inquiries after him; while she herself went to the gate&mdash;to
      the ramparts&mdash;everywhere, in short, that she thought it likely she
      could gain any information,&mdash;but everywhere without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The giants, meanwhile, with Xit, betook themselves to their lodgings in
      the By-ward Tower. The herald and the men-at-anns, who, it may be
      remembered, had charge of the prisoner Gilbert, not having received any
      further instructions respecting him, accompanied them thither. They were
      also attended by Master Edward Underhill, who was bent upon admonishing
      them, having been given to understand they were relapsing into papacy.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0074.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Arrived at the entrance of the By-ward Tower, the giants volunteered to
      take charge of the prisoner till the morning&mdash;an offer which was
      gladly accepted by the herald, who, intrusting him to their care,
      departed. But the Gospeller was not to be got rid of so easily. He begged
      to be admitted, and, partly by entreaties, partly by a bribe to the dwarf,
      succeeded in his object. The first care of the giants, on entering their
      abode&mdash;an octagonal chamber of stone, about sixteen feet wide, and
      twenty high, with a vaulted coiling, supported by sharp groined arches of
      great beauty, springing from small slender columns,&mdash;was to light a
      candle placed in front of an ancient projecting stone fireplace. Their
      next was to thrust the prisoner into the arched embrasure of a loop-hole
      at one side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the chamber were decorated with the arms and accoutrements of
      the gigantic brethren,&mdash;the size of which would have been sufficient
      to strike any chance-beholder with wonder. Over the embrasure in which
      they had placed the prisoner, hung an enormous pair of gauntlets, and a
      morion of equal size. Here was a quiver full of arrows, each shaft far
      exceeding a cloth-yard in length&mdash;there a formidable club, armed with
      sharp steel spikes; while the fire-place was garnished with a couple of
      immense halberts. Having drawn a large pot of wine, which they first
      offered to their guest, who refused it, they each took a deep draught; and
      informing Underhill, if he was still resolved to hold forth, he had better
      commence without further delay, they disposed themselves to listen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing a small table in the centre of the chamber, Og seated himself
      opposite it, and took Xit upon his knee; while Gog sat down beside him,
      and Magog supported his huge bulk against the wall. Divesting himself of
      his cap and sword, and placing an hour-glass on the table, the
      Hot-gospeller then opened a small volume, which he took from beneath his
      cloak; from which he began to read certain passages and to comment upon
      them in a vehement tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0014" id="linkimage-0014"> </a>

      <a href="images/0076.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      His exhortation opened with a burst of rejoicing on the accession of Queen
      Jane&mdash;in which he pronounced terrible anathemas against all those who
      sought to restore the fallen religion. Perceiving the fierce gaze of the
      prisoner fixed upon him, he directed his chief thunders against him, and,
      excited by his subject, soon worked himself into a state approaching to
      frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this strain he continued for some time, when a sound arose which
      drowned even his vehemence. Overcome with drowsiness, the three giants,
      who for a short time vainly endeavoured to attend to the discourse of the
      Gospeller, had now sunk into a comfortable slumber&mdash;and the noise
      which they made was tremendous. In vain Underhill endeavoured to rouse
      them by thumping the table. Gog gazed at him for an instant with half-shut
      eyes, and then leaning on Og's shoulder, who, with head dropped back and
      mouth wide open, was giving audible proof of his insensible condition, he
      speedily dropped asleep again. Such was the astounding din, that the
      Gospeller could not even make himself heard by the dwarf, who, perched on
      Og's knee at a few paces' distance, stared in amazement at his
      gesticulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than an hour having passed in this manner, the Hot-gospeller, whose
      energies were wholly exhausted, came to a pause; and after menacing his
      insensible audience with proportionate punishment in the next world&mdash;especially
      the idolatrous prisoner, whom he threatened with gesture as well as with
      word&mdash;he closed his volume, and prepared to depart. With some
      difficulty the three giants were awakened; and it was only by the
      assistance of Xit, who tweaked their noses and plucked their beards, that
      this could be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Master Underhill was taking his leave, Dame Trusbut arrived in the
      greatest tribulation. The fair Cicely was nowhere to be found. Her husband
      had been to the palace. Nothing could be heard of the young esquire; nor
      could Lawrence Nightgall be met with. In this emergency, she had come to
      entreat the giants to aid her in her search. They agreed to go at once&mdash;and
      Xit was delighted with the prospect of such employment. Accordingly, the
      door was locked upon the prisoner, and they set forth with the distracted
      dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was left alone, Gilbert surveyed the chamber to sec if there
      was any means by which he might effect his escape. An idea speedily
      occurred to him: by the help of one of the halberts he contrived to free
      himself from his bonds, and then clambered up the chimney.

      VII.&mdash;HOW CUTHBERT CHOLMONDELEY WAS THROWN INTO A DUNGEON NEAR THE
      DEVILIN TOWER; AND HOW A MYSTERIOUS FEMALE FIGURE APPEARED TO HIM THERE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n recovering from
      the stunning effects of the blow he had received, Cuthbert Cholmondeley
      found himself stretched on the floor of a gloomy vault, or dungeon, for
      such he judged it. At first, he thought he must be dreaming, and tried to
      shake off the horrible nightmare by which he supposed himself oppressed.
      But a moment's reflection undeceived him; and starting to his feet, he
      endeavoured to explore the cell in which he was confined. A heavy chain,
      which bound his leg to the floor, prevented him from moving more than a
      few paces; and, convinced that escape was impossible, he sank upon the
      ground in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to assign any cause for his imprisonment, and wholly at a loss to
      imagine what offence he had committed, he taxed his brain as to everything
      that had recently happened to him. This naturally directed his thoughts to
      the fair Cicely&mdash;and with her gentle image came the recollection of
      the malicious countenance and threatening gestures of Lawrence Nightgall.
      Remembering what Magog had told him of the jealousy and vindictive nature
      of this person, and remembering also that he had heard him described as
      the chief jailer, he felt that he need seek no further for the motive and
      the author of his imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assurance, however, which he had thus gained, afforded him no
      consolation, but rather tended to increase his disquietude. If he had been
      a prisoner of state, he might have hoped for eventual release; but placed
      in the hands of so remorseless and unscrupulous an enemy as Nightgall had
      shown himself, he felt he had little to hope. This consideration filled
      him with anguish, which was heightened as he thought of the triumph of his
      savage rival, who by some means&mdash;for he seemed desperate enough to
      have recourse to any expedient&mdash;might possess himself of the object
      of his passion. Fired by this thought, Cholmondeley again sprang to his
      feet, and strove with all his force to burst his bondage. But the effort
      was fruitless; and by lacerating his hands, and straining his limbs, he
      only added bodily torture to his mental suffering. Exhausted at length, he
      sank once more upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, having become habituated to the gloom of the place, he
      fancied he could make out that it was an arched cell of a few feet in
      width, and corresponding height. The only light admitted was from the
      entrance, which appeared to open upon a passage branching off on the left,
      and upon a further range of dungeons extending in the same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not altogether unacquainted with the prisons of the Tower, Cholmondeley
      felt against the walls to try whether he could find any of those
      melancholy memorials which their unfortunate inmates delighted to bequeath
      to their successors, and which might serve as a clue to the particular
      place of his confinement. But nothing but the smooth surface of the stone
      met his touch. This circumstance, however, and the peculiar form of the
      cell, induced him to think that it must be situated beneath, or at no
      great distance from the Devilin Tower, as he had heard of a range of
      subterranean dungeons in that quarter: and, it may be added, he was right
      in his conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cell in which he was thrown was part of a series of such dreadful
      receptacles, contrived in the thickness of the ballium wall, and extending
      from the Beauchamp Tower to the Devilin Tower. They were appropriated to
      those prisoners who were doomed to confinement for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horrible recollections then flashed upon his mind of the dreadful
      sufferings he had heard that the miserable wretches immured in these
      dungeons underwent&mdash;how some were tortured&mdash;some destroyed by
      secret and expeditious means&mdash;others by the more lingering process of
      starvation. As the latter idea crossed him, he involuntarily stretched out
      his hand to ascertain whether any provisions had been left him; but he
      could find none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood froze in his veins as he thought of dying thus; his hair
      stiffened upon his head; and he was only prevented from crying out to make
      his lamentable case known to the occupants of any of the adjoining cells,
      by the conviction of its utter futility. But this feeling passed away, and
      was succeeded by calmer and more consolatory reflections. While in this
      frame of mind, Nature asserted her sway, and he dropped asleep.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      How long he remained thus, he knew not; but he was awakened by a loud and
      piercing scream. Raising himself, he listened intently. The scream was
      presently repeated in a tone so shrill and unearthly, that it filled him
      with apprehensions of a new kind. The outcry having been a third time
      raised, he was debating within himself whether he should in any way reply
      to it, when he thought he beheld a shadowy figure glide along the passage.
      It paused at a short distance from him. A glimmer of light fell upon the
      arch on the left, but the place where the figure stood was buried in
      darkness. After gazing for some time at the mysterious visitant, and
      passing his hand across his brow to assure himself that his eyesight did
      not deceive him, Cholmondeley summoned courage enough to address it. No
      answer was returned; but the figure, which had the semblance of a female,
      with the hands raised and clasped together as if in supplication or
      prayer, and with a hood drawn over the face, remained perfectly
      motionless. Suddenly, it glided forward, but with a step so noiseless and
      swift, that almost before the esquire was aware of the movement, it was at
      his side. He then felt a hand cold as marble placed upon his own, and upon
      grasping the fingers they appeared so thin and bony, that he thought he
      must have encountered a skeleton. Paralysed with fright, Cholmondeley
      shrunk back as far as he was able; but the figure pursued him, and
      shrieked in his ear&mdash;"My child, my child!&mdash;you have taken my
      child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Convinced from the voice that he had a being of this world to deal with,
      the esquire seized her vestment, and resolved to detain her till he had
      ascertained who she was and what was the cause of her cries; but just as
      he had begun to question her, a distant footstep was heard, ands uttering
      a loud shriek, and crying&mdash;"He comes!&mdash;he comes!"&mdash;the
      female broke from him and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh shrieks were presently heard in a more piteous tone than before,
      mixed with angry exclamations in a man's voice, which Cholmondeley fancied
      sounded like that of Nightgall. A door was next shut with great violence;
      and all became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was musing on this strange occurrence, Cholmondeley heard
      footsteps advancing along the passage on the left, and in another moment
      Lawrence Nightgall stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer, who carried a lamp, eyed the captive for a few moments in
      silence, and with savage satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to you, then, I owe my imprisonment, villain," said Cholmondeley,
      regarding him sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," replied the jailer; "and you can readily conjecture, I doubt not,
      why I have thus dealt with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can," resumed the esquire; "your jealousy prompted you to the deed. But
      you shall bitterly rue it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" exclaimed Nightgall. "You are wholly in my power. I am not,
      however, come to threaten, but to offer you freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what terms?" demanded Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On these," replied the jailer, scowling&mdash;"that you swear to abandon
      Cicely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" replied the esquire.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      "Then your fate is sealed," rejoined Nightgall. "You shall never quit this
      spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think not to move me by any such idle threat," returned Cholmondeley.
      "You dare not detain me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who shall prevent me?" laughed the jailor, scornfully. "I, alone, possess
      the key of these dungeons. You are their sole occupant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is false," retorted the esquire. "There is another captive,&mdash;a
      miserable female,&mdash;whom I, myself, have seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she been here?" cried Nightgall, with a look of disquietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not many minutes since," replied the other, fixing a scrutinizing glance
      upon him. "She came in search of her child. What have you done with it,
      villain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley had no particular object in making the inquiry. But he was
      astonished at the effect produced by it on the jailer, who started and
      endeavoured to hide his confusion by pulling his cap over his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is a maniac," he said, at length, in a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be so," rejoined the esquire, severely; "she has been driven out of
      her senses by your barbarous usage. I more than suspect you have murdered
      her child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entertain what suspicions you please," replied Nightgall, evidently
      relieved by the surmise. "I am not accountable for the ravings of a
      distracted woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is she?" demanded the esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The names of those confined within these cells are never divulged,'"
      returned the jailer. "She has been a prisoner of state for nineteen
      years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And during that term her child was born&mdash;ha?" pursued Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer no further questions," replied Nightgall, doggedly. "One
      word before I depart. I am not your only enemy. You have others more
      powerful, and equally implacable. You have incurred the displeasure of the
      Privy Council, and I have a warrant, under the hands of its chief members,
      for your execution. I am now about to summon the headsman for the task."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your offer to liberate me was mere mockery," observed the esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," replied the other; "and I again repeat it. Swear to abandon
      Cicely, and to maintain profound silence as to what you have just seen,
      and I will convey you by a secret passage underneath the Tower moat to a
      place of security, where you will be beyond the reach of your enemies, and
      will take the risk of your escape upon myself. Do you agree to this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Cholmondeley, firmly. "I distrust your statement, and defy
      your malice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obstinate fool!" growled the jailer. "Prepare to meet your fate in an
      hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever it comes it will find me prepared," rejoined the esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall glared at him fiercely for a moment from beneath his shaggy
      brows. He then strode sullenly away. But his departure was prevented by
      Cicely, who suddenly appeared at the mouth of the dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You here!" he exclaimed recoiling, and trembling as if an apparition had
      crossed his path. "How have you obtained admittance?",
    </p>
    <p>
      "It matters not," she answered. "I am come to purchase your prisoner's
      freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the terms?" rejoined the jailer, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," she replied; "and will comply with them when you have fulfilled
      your share of the compact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cicely!" cried Cholmondeley, who had been to the full as much astonished
      at her unexpected appearance as the jailer. "Cicely!" he cried, starting
      to his feet, and extending his hands towards her. "Do not consent to his
      proposal. Do not sacrifice yourself for me. I would die a thousand deaths
      rather than you should be his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heed him not," interposed Nightgall, grasping her arm, and preventing her
      from approaching her lover; "but attend to me. You see this warrant," he
      added, producing a parchment. "It is from the Council, and directs that
      the prisoner's execution shall take place in such manner as may best
      consist with despatch and secrecy. If I deliver it to Manger, the
      headsman, it will be promptly obeyed. And I <i>shall</i> deliver it,
      unless you promise compliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The villain deceives you, dear Cicely," cried Cholmondeley, in a voice of
      anguish. "The Council have not the power of life and death. They cannot&mdash;dare
      not order my execution without form or trial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Council will answer for their actions themselves," rejoined
      Nightgall, carelessly. "Their warrant will bear me and my comrades
      harmless. Mauger will not hesitate to act upon it. What is your
      determination, Cicely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Free him," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Recal your words, sweet Cicely," cried Cholmondeley, throwing himself at
      her feet, "if you have any love for me. You doom me to worse than death by
      this submission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cholmondeley," she replied in a mournful voice, "my resolution is taken,
      and even you cannot induce me to change it. The opening of our love has
      been blighted. My heart has been crushed, almost before it knew for whom
      it beat. It matters not now what becomes of me. If my life could preserve
      yours, or restore you to freedom, I would freely yield it. But as nothing
      will suffice except my hand, I give that. Think of me no more,&mdash;or
      think of me only as another's.'''
    </p>
    <p>
      "That thought were madness!" groaned Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Lawrence Nightgall," continued Cicely, "you say you can conduct
      the prisoner beyond the walls of the Tower, Bring me back some token that
      you have done so, and I am yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly," replied the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Retire then for a moment, while I arrange with him what the token shall
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Refuse, and I retract my promise," she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the jailer, with a suspicious look, reluctantly left the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cicely, my beloved," cried Cholmondeley, clasping her in his arms, "why&mdash;why
      have you done this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To preserve you," she replied, hurriedly. "Once out of this dungeon, I
      can bring assistance to liberate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" ejaculated Nightgall, who, having placed his ear to the wall,
      lost not a syllable of their discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be unavailing," replied Cholmondeley. "No one will venture to
      oppose an order of the Council. You must make known my case to Lord
      Guilford Dudley. Take this ring. Explain all to him, and I may yet be
      saved. Do you hear me, Cicely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," she replied "And I," added Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In case you fail," continued the esquire, "the token of my escape shall
      be"&mdash;And placing his lips close to her ear, he spoke a few words in
      so low a tone, that they escaped the jailer. "Till you receive that token
      treat Nightgall as before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubt it not," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am content," said the esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see through the design," muttered the jailer, "and will defeat it. Have
      you done?" he added, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A moment," replied Cholmondeloy, again pressing the damsel to his bosom,
      "I would sooner part with my life's-blood than resign you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must go," she cried, disengaging herself from his embrace. "Now, Master
      Nightgall, I am ready to attend you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In an hour I shall return and release you," said the jailer, addressing
      the prisoner. "Your hand, Cicely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go alone," she replied, shrinking from him with a look of
      abhorrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please," he rejoined, with affected carelessness. "You are mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till I have received the token. Farewell!" she murmured, turning her
      tearful gaze upon Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For ever!" exclaimed the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as they quitted the cell, he threw himself despairingly on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Issuing from the outer door of the dungeon, Cicely and her companion took
      their way towards the Stone Kitchen. They had not proceeded far, when they
      perceived several persons approaching them, who, as they drew nearer,
      proved to be Dame Potentia, Xit, and the giants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you been doing, Cicely?" inquired her adoptive mother, angrily.
      "I have been searching for you everywhere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall know anon," replied the maiden. "But come with me to the
      palace. I must see Lord Guilford Dudley, or the Duke of Northumberland,
      without a moment's delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Warders," interposed Nightgall, authoritatively: "go to Master Manger's
      lodging in the Bloody Tower. Bid him hasten with two assistants, and the
      sworn tormentor, to the dungeon beneath the Devilin Tower. He will know
      which I mean. Justice is about to be done upon a prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no&mdash;no&mdash;do not go," cried Cicely, arresting the giants. "He
      does not mean it. He is jesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go home, then, and do not stir forth till I bring you the token,"
      rejoined Nightgall, in a deep whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Heaven's name, what is the meaning of all this?" cried Dame Potentia,
      in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will inform you," replied the jailer, drawing her aside. "Your daughter
      was about to elope with the young esquire. I detected them trying to
      escape by the secret passage beneath the moat, of which you know I have
      the key. Lock her within her chamber. Pay no attention to her tears,
      entreaties, or assertions. And, above all, take care no one has any
      communication with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me to guard her," rejoined Dame Potentia. "I know what these
      court-gallants are. They will venture anything, and contrive anything,
      when a pretty girl is concerned. But what has happened to the esquire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is safe for the present," answered Nightgall, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely, meantime, had availed herself of their conversation, to whisper a
      few words to Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this ring," she said, placing the ornament given her by her lover,
      in the hands of the dwarf, "and fly to the palace. Show it to Lord
      Guilford Dudley, and say that the wearer is imprisoned in the dungeons
      beneath the Devilin Tower. Assistance must be speedily rendered, as he is
      ordered for immediate and secret execution. Do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most precisely, lovely damsel," replied Xit, kissing her hand, as he took
      the ring; "and I guess the name and condition of the prisoner, as well as
      the nature of the interest you take in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fly!" interrupted Cicely. "Not a moment is to be lost. You shall be well
      rewarded for your trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desire no higher reward than your thanks, adorable maiden," replied
      Xit. "Your behests shall be punctually obeyed." So saying, he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, young mistress," cried Dame Potentia, seizing her adoptive
      daughter's arm, "you must to your chamber. You have led me and your
      father, and these worthy warders, a pretty dance. But you shall lead us
      all where you list, if I let you out of my sight in future."
    </p>
    <p>
      And thanking the giants, who had looked on in speechless astonishment, she
      dragged Cicely along with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember!" whispered Nightgall, as he walked a few paces by the side of
      the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall expect the token in an hour," she answered in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it," he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, he halted, and retraced his steps. The others then separated.
      Cicely was conveyed to the Stone Kitchen; and the giants, after looking in
      vain for Xit, and calling to him repeatedly but without effect, returned
      to the By-ward Tower. Just as they reached it, a shot was fired from the
      battlements, and was immediately answered from those of the Middle Tower.
      Other reports followed. And, alarmed by the sounds, the huge brethren
      hastily unlocked the door of their lodging, and entering it, to their
      infinite dismay, found the prisoner gone.

      VIII.&mdash;HOW GILBERT ESCAPED FROM THE BY-WARD TOWER, AND SWAM ACROSS
      THE MOAT; HOW OG HUNG XIT UPON A HOOK; AND HOW LAWRENCE NIGHTGALL BROUGHT
      THE TOKEN TO CICELY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>ilbert having
      freed himself from his bonds, and clambered into the chimney in the
      By-ward Tower in the manner previously related, ascended without any
      inconvenience, except what was occasioned by the pungent smoke arising
      from the blazing fagots beneath, until he reached the level of the upper
      story, where another fire-place, connected with the passage up which he
      was mounting, so narrowed its limits, that it seemed scarcely possible to
      proceed further. The sound of voices in the chamber on this floor also
      alarmed him, and for some minutes he suspended his labour to listen. But
      as nothing occurred to disturb him, and it was evident, from the
      conversation of the speakers, that he had not been noticed, he presently
      resumed his task, and redoubling his efforts, soon vanquished all
      obstacles, and gained the opening of the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a fresh difficulty awaited him; and one for which he was wholly
      unprepared. The smoke found a vent through a small circular opening or
      louver, as it was termed,&mdash;for there was no chimney-top to disperse
      it to the air,&mdash;in the battlements. Through this opening he must
      necessarily creep; and, provided he could accomplish the feat, he had to
      elude the vigilance of the sentinels stationed on the roof of the turret.
      Luckily, the night was profoundly dark; and the gloom, increased by a
      thick mist from the river, was so intense, that an object could scarcely
      be discerned at a foot's distance. Thus favoured, Gilbert resolved to
      hazard the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching his opportunity, he drew himself cautiously through the louver,
      and without being noticed by the sentinel, who was standing beside it,
      crouched beneath the carriage of a culverin. In this state, he remained
      for a short time, meditating what course he should next pursue, and
      nerving himself for some desperate attempt, when a door at the side of the
      southern turret suddenly opened, and three men-at-arms, the foremost of
      whom carried a torch, came to relieve guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware that he should now infallibly be discovered, Gilbert started to his
      feet, and drawing a dagger which he had picked up in the giants' chamber,
      stood upon his defence. The movement betrayed him. Though confounded by
      his appearance, the sentinel nearest him presented his partizan at his
      breast and commanded him to surrender. Gilbert answered by striking up the
      man's arm, and instantly sprang over the battlements.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud splash told that he had fallen into the moat. The men held the
      torch over the side of the turret. But it was too dark to distinguish any
      object below. Presently, however, a noise was heard in the water that
      convinced them the fugitive was swimming for the opposite bank. One of the
      soldiers instantly discharged his caliver in the direction of the sound,&mdash;but
      without effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This served as an alarm to the guards posted on the western ramparts, as
      well as to those on the Middle Tower, both of which commanded this part of
      the moat, and other shots were immediately fired. A signal was then
      rapidly passed from tower to tower, and from portal to portal, until it
      reached the Bulwark-gate, which formed the only entrance to the fortress
      on the west, and a body of armed men carrying lights instantly sallied
      forth and hurried towards the side of the moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gilbert, meanwhile, swam for his life. Guided by the torches, which served
      to discover his enemies rather than to betray him, he effected a secure
      landing, But before he had climbed the steep bank, he was observed by a
      soldier, who, making towards him, shouted to his comrades for assistance.
      In the struggle that ensued, the torch borne by the soldier was
      extinguished, and bursting from him, Gilbert darted at a swift pace up
      Tower-hill. His pursuers were close upon him. But, well acquainted with
      the spot, he contrived to baffle them, by flinging himself beneath the
      permanent scaffold, then standing upon the brow of the eminence, and thus
      eluded observation. As soon as his foes had passed, he struck off swiftly
      to the left, and leaping a low wall, skirted All-hallows Church, and
      speedily gained Tower-street.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Gilbert was flying in this direction, his pursuers finding
      themselves at fault, hastened back, and endeavoured to discover some trace
      of him. Some mounted the steps of the scaffold to see whether he had taken
      refuge on its blood-stained planks,&mdash;some crept under it,&mdash;others
      examined the posts of the neighbouring gallows,&mdash;while a fourth party
      flew to the postern gate, which defended the southern extremity of the
      city wall, in the hope that he might have been stopped by the watch. All,
      however, it is needless to say, were disappointed. And after some time had
      been fruitlessly expended, the whole party returned to the Tower to report
      the unsuccessful issue of their expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the report of the musquetry had reached the ears of Lord
      Clinton, the constable, who, attended by the lieutenant, the
      gentleman-porter, and a numerous patrol, chanced to be making the round of
      the fortifications at the time, and he descended to the gates to ascertain
      the cause of the alarm. On learning it, he immediately summoned the herald
      and the gigantic warders to his presence, and after sharply rebuking the
      former for neglect, ordered him into custody till the morning, when he
      proposed to take the duke's pleasure as to his punishment. He then turned
      to the giants, who tried to soften his displeasure by taking the blame
      upon themselves, and telling them he would listen to their statement when
      the herald was examined, and, in the interim, they would be answerable
      with their lives for any further dereliction of duty, he dismissed the
      assemblage, and returned with his train to the ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who had been gathered together in the guardroom near the
      By-ward Tower,&mdash;where the foregoing examination took place,&mdash;were
      Nightgall and Xit,&mdash;the latter having just returned from the palace,
      after a vain attempt to deliver his message to Lord Guilford Dudley, who,
      it has been already stated, was engaged at the time in secret conference
      with the Duke of Northumberland, and could not therefore be spoken with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever on the alert, and suspicious of those around him, Night-gall
      overheard Og question the dwarf as to the cause of his absence; and
      perceiving, from Xit's manner, that he had some secret to communicate, he
      contrived to approach them unobserved. He then learnt the message with
      which the dwarf had been entrusted by Cicely, and enraged at her endeavour
      to overreach him, snatched the ring from him as he was displaying it to
      the giant, and threatened him with severe punishment, if he dared to
      meddle further in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had recovered from his surprise, the affronted mannikin drew
      his rapier, and making several passes at Nightgall, would have certainly
      wounded him, if he had not dextrously avoided the blows by interposing the
      huge bulk of the giant between him and his assailant. The fury of the
      dwarf was so excessive, and the contortions into which he threw himself so
      inconceivably diverting, that Og could render him no assistance for
      laughing. Thrusting his sword between the giant's legs,&mdash;now cutting
      on the right, now on the left,&mdash;Xit tried in every way to hit the
      jailer, and must have succeeded, if Og, who was by no means desirous to
      have blood shed in so ridiculous a fray, and who enjoyed the pastime too
      much to speedily terminate it, had not prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gog, moreover, having on the onset disarmed Nightgall, he could not
      protect himself except by keeping under the shelter of the giant. Foiled
      in his attempts, Xit's indignation knew no bounds, and exasperated by the
      derisive shouts and laughter of the spectators, he threatened to turn his
      sword against Og if he did not deliver up the jailer to his vengeance.
      This only produced louder roars of merriment from the by-standers; and the
      dwarf, whose passion had almost deprived him of reason, uttering a shrill
      scream like a child robbed of its plaything, threw himself on Og's leg,
      and scrambled up his body, with the intention of descending on the other
      side, and exterminating his foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feat raised the merriment of the spectators to the utmost. Og
      suffered the imp to ascend without opposition, and clinging to the points
      of the giant's slashed red hose, Xit drew himself up to his broad girdle,
      and then setting one foot on the circlet of raised gold thread which
      surrounded the badge on his breast, soon gained his shoulder, and would
      have leapt from thence upon his foe, if Og, who began to think it time to
      put an end to the sport, had not seized him by the leg as he was in the
      act of springing off, and held him at arm's-length, with his heels
      upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      After many useless struggles to liberate himself, and menaces of what he
      would do when he got free, which, as may be supposed, only provoked still
      further the laughter of the by-standers, Xit became so unmanageable, that
      Og fastened him by his nether garments to a hook in the wall, about
      fourteen feet from the ground, and left him to recover himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus perched, the dwarf hurled his rapier at Nightgall's head, and replied
      to the jeers of the assemblage by such mops and mows as an enraged ape is
      wont to make at its persecutors. After the lapse of a few minutes,
      however, he began to find his position so uncomfortable, that he was fain
      to supplicate for release, to which, on receiving his assurance of quieter
      conduct for the future, Og consented, and accordingly unhooked him, and
      set him on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall, meanwhile, had taken advantage of this diversion, to leave the
      Guard-room, and hasten to the Stone Kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dame Potentia was just retiring to rest as the jailer reached her
      dwelling, and it was only by the most urgent importunity that he succeeded
      in obtaining admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pardon, good dame," he said, as the door was opened. "I have that to
      tell Cicely, which will effectually cure her love for the young esquire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, you are right welcome, Master Nightgall," she replied; "for
      the poor child has almost cried her pretty eyes out since I brought her
      home. And I have been so moved by her tears, that I greatly misdoubt, if
      her lover had presented himself instead of you, whether I should have had
      the heart to refuse to let him see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fool!" muttered Nightgall, half aside. "Where is she?" he added, aloud.
      "I have no time to lose. I have a secret execution to attend before
      day-break."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours is a butcherly office, Master Nightgall," observed Peter Trusbut,
      who was dozing in an arm-chair by the fire. "Those secret executions, to
      my mind, are little better than state murders. I would not, for all the
      power of the Duke of Northumberland, hold your office, or that of Gilliam
      Mauger, the headsman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I yours, on the same fee, Master Pantler," rejoined Nightgall.
      "Tastes differ. Where is your daughter, good dame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In her chamber," replied Potentia. "Ho! Cicely, sweetheart!" she added,
      knocking at a door at the end of a short passage leading out of the
      kitchen on the right. "Here is Master Nightgall desires to speak with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does he bring me the token?" demanded the maiden, from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay marry, does he, child," replied the dame, winking at the jailer.
      "Heaven forgive me the falsehood," she added,&mdash;"for I know not what
      she means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave us a moment, dear mother," said Cicely, hastily unfastening the
      door. "Now, Master Nightgall," she continued, as Dame Potentia retired,
      and the jailer entered the room, "have you fulfilled your compact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cicely," rejoined the jailer, regarding her sternly, "you have not kept
      faith with me. You have despatched a messenger to the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! he is free," exclaimed the maiden, joyfully,&mdash;"your plans have
      been defeated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall smiled bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My messenger cannot have failed," she continued, with a sudden change of
      countenance. "I am sure Lord Guilford would not abandon his favourite
      esquire. Tell me, what has happened?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am come to claim fulfilment of your pledge," rejoined the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have set him free," cried Cicely. "Where is the token?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behold it," replied Nightgall, raising his hand, on which her lover's
      ring sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lost!&mdash;lost!" shrieked Cicely, falling senseless upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer gazed at her a moment in silence, but did not attempt to offer
      any assistance. He then turned upon his heel, and strode out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look to your daughter, dame," he observed, as he passed through the
      Stone-kitchen.

    <h2>
      IX.&mdash;OF THE MYSTERIOUS MANNER IN WHICH GUNNORA BRAOSE WAS BROUGHT TO
      THE TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>urrying along
      Tower Street, and traversing Eastcheap and Watling Street&mdash;then
      narrow but picturesque thoroughfares&mdash;Gilbert,&mdash;to whom it is
      now necessary to return,&mdash;did not draw breath till he reached the
      eastern extremity of St. Paul's. As he passed this reverend and matchless
      structure&mdash;the destruction of which, was the heaviest loss sustained
      by the metropolis in the Great Fire&mdash;he strained his eyes towards its
      lofty tower, but the gloom was too profound to enable him to discern
      anything of it beyond a dark and heavy mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou art at present benighted, glorious fane!" he cried aloud. "But a
      bright dawn shall arise for thee, and all thy ancient splendour, with thy
      ancient faith, be restored. If I could see Mary queen, and hear mass
      solemnized within thy walls, I could die content."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you shall hear it," said a voice in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who speaks?" asked Gilbert, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be at St. Paul's Cross to-morrow at midnight, and you shall know,"
      replied the voice. "You are a loyal subject of Queen Mary., and a true
      Catholic, or your words belie you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am both," answered Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fail not to meet me then," rejoined the other, "and you shall receive
      assurance that your wishes shall be fulfilled. There are those at work who
      will speedily accomplish the object you desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will aid them heart and hand," cried Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name?" demanded the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am called Gilbert Pot," answered the youth, "and am drawer to Ninion
      Saunders, at the Baptist's Head, in Ludgate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A vintner's boy!" exclaimed the other, disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, a vintner's boy," returned Gilbert. "But, when the usurper, Jane
      Dudley, was proclaimed at Cheapside this morning, mine was the only voice
      raised for Queen Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For which bold deed you were nailed to the pillory," rejoined the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was," replied Gilbert; "and was, moreover, carried to the Tower, whence
      I have just escaped."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your courage shall not pass unrequited," replied the speaker. "Where are
      you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my master's, at the Baptist's Head, at the corner of Creed Lane&mdash;not
      a bow-shot hence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will not be safe to go thither," observed the other. "Your master will
      deliver you to the watch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will risk it, nevertheless," answered Gilbert. "I have an old grandame
      whom I desire to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something strikes me!" exclaimed the other. "Is your grandame the old
      woman who warned the usurper Jane not to proceed to the Tower?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is," returned Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a strange encounter, in good sooth," cried the other. "She is the
      person I am in search of. You must procure me instant speech with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will conduct you to her, right willingly, sir," replied Gilbert. "But
      she says little to any one, and may refuse to answer your questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see," rejoined the other. "Lead on, good Gilbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed by his unknown companion, about whom he felt a strange curiosity,
      not unalloyed with fear, Gilbert proceeded at a rapid pace towards his
      destination. The whole of the buildings then surrounding Saint Paul's, it
      is almost unnecessary to say, were destroyed by the same fire that
      consumed the Cathedral; and, though the streets still retain their
      original names, their situation is in some respects changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing beneath the shade of a large tree, which then grew at the western
      boundary of the majestic edifice, Gilbert darted through a narrow entry
      into Ave Maria Lane, and turning to the left, speedily reached Ludgate,
      which he crossed at some fifty paces from the Gate&mdash;then used, like
      several of the other city portals, as a prison&mdash;and, entering Creed
      Lane, halted before a low-built house on the right. The shutters were
      closed, but it was evident, from the uproarious sounds issuing from the
      dwelling, that revelry was going on within. Gilbert did not deem it
      prudent to open the street door, but calling to his companion, he went to
      the back of the tavern, and gained admittance through a window on the
      ground floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are having a merry rouse," he observed to the other, "in honour of
      the usurper; and my master, Ninion, will be too far gone to notice aught
      except his guests and his sack brewage, so that I may safely conduct your
      worship to my grandame. But first let me strike a light."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, he searched about for flint and steel, and having found them,
      presently set fire to a small lamp hanging against the wall, which he
      removed and turned, not without some apprehension, towards the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance fell upon a tall man, with an ample feuille-morte coloured
      cloak thrown over his left shoulder, so as completely to muffle the lower
      part of his features. Gilbert could see nothing of the stranger's face,
      except an aquiline nose, and a pair of piercing black eyes; but the
      expression of the latter was so stern and searching, that his own regards
      involuntarily sank before them. A bonnet of black velvet, decorated with a
      single drooping feather, drawn over the brow, added to the stranger's
      disguise. But what was revealed of the physiognomy was so striking, that
      Gilbert was satisfied he should never forget it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something, indeed, there was of majesty in the stranger's demeanour, that,
      coupled with his sinister looks and the extraordinary brilliancy of his
      eyes, impressed the superstitious youth with the notion that he was in the
      presence of an unearthly being. Struck by this idea, he glanced at the
      stranger's feet, in expectation of finding one of the distinctive marks of
      the Prince of Darkness. But he beheld nothing except a finely-formed limb,
      clothed in black silk hose and a velvet shoe, above which hung the point
      of a lengthy rapier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am neither the enemy of mankind nor your enemy, good youth," observed
      the stranger, who guessed the cause of Gilbert's apprehensions. "Bring
      your grandame hither, and take heed how you approach her, or your looks
      will alarm her more than mine do you."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not without reason that this caution was given. Gilbert's
      appearance was ghastly in the extreme. His countenance was haggard with
      the loss of blood; his garments torn and saturated with moisture; and his
      black dripping locks, escaping from the blood-stained bandage around his
      head, contrasted fearfully with the deathly paleness of his visage.
      Acknowledging the justice of the suggestion, Gilbert decided upon
      proceeding in the dark, that his appearance might not be observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he crept cautiously up stairs, and returned in a few minutes
      with his aged relative. Gilbert found the stranger in the same attitude he
      had left him, and his appearance startled Gunnora, as much as it had done
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing herself, she glanced uneasily at the mysterious stranger. From
      him her eye wandered to Gilbert; and terrified by his haggard looks, she
      cried in a tone of anxiety, "You have suffered much, my child. The ill
      news reached me of the shameful punishment with which you have been
      visited for your loyalty to your true Queen. I heard also that you had
      been conveyed a prisoner to the Tower; and was about to make suit to the
      gracious lady, Jane Dudley, in your behalf. Was I wrongfully informed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, mother, you were not," replied Gilbert. "But heed me not. There
      stands the worshipful gentleman who desires to speak with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ready to answer his questions," said Gunnora. "Let him propose
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, let me tell you, dame," said the stranger, "that your grandsons
      devotion to Queen Mary shall not pass unrequited. Ere many days&mdash;perchance
      many hours&mdash;shall have passed, he shall exchange his serge doublet
      for a suit of velvet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear that, mother," exclaimed Gilbert, joyfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you that make him the offer?" asked Gunnora, stedfastly regarding
      the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall know, anon," he replied. "Suffice it, I can make good my words.
      Your presence is required in the Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Lady Jane,&mdash;I should say by the queen?" rejoined Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Privy Council," returned the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they seek from me?" demanded the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To testify to the death of his late Majesty, King Edward the Sixth,"
      replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing," rejoined the stranger. "The council will befriend you.
      Their object is to prove that Edward was poisoned by Northumberland's
      order. Can you do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can," replied Gunnora. "My hand administered the fatal draught."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours, mother!" ejaculated Gilbert, horror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prove this, and Northumberland will lose his head," said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were my own to fall with it, I would do so," replied Gunnora. "My sole
      wish is to avenge my foster-son, the great Duke of Somerset, who fell by
      Northumberland's foul practices. It was therefore when all the physicians
      of the royal household were dismissed, and the duke sent messengers for
      empirical aid, that I presented myself, and offered my services. When I
      beheld the royal sufferer, I saw he had but short space to live. But short
      as it was, it was too long for the duke. A potion was prepared by
      Northumberland, which I administered. From that moment his highness grew
      worse, and in six hours he was a corpse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a cursed deed," cried Gilbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied Gunnora, "it was so, and Heaven will surely avenge it. But
      I did it to get Northumberland into my power. The king's case was past all
      remedy. But he might have lingered for days and weeks, and the duke was
      impatient for the crown. I was impatient too&mdash;but it was for his
      head. And therefore I did his bidding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your vengeance shall be fully gratified," replied the stranger. "Come
      with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" exclaimed Gunnora. "How will his testimony affect the Lady Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will deprive her of her crown&mdash;perchance her head," rejoined the
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it shall never be uttered," replied Gunnora, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Torture shall wring it from you," cried the stranger, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman drew herself up to her full height, and, regarding the
      stranger fixedly, answered in a stern tone&mdash;"Let it be tried upon
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother," said Gilbert, striding between them, and drawing his dagger, "go
      back to your own room. You shall not peril your safety thus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush!" exclaimed the stranger, impatiently. "No harm shall befal her. I
      thought you were both loyal subjects of Queen Mary. How can she assume the
      sovereign power while Jane grasps the sceptre?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you aim at her life?" said Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the stranger, "I would preserve her. My object is to destroy
      Northumberland, and restore the crown to her to whom it rightfully
      belongs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case I will go with you," returned the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will fall into a snare," interposed her grandson. "Let him declare
      who he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will reveal my name to your grandame, boy," replied the stranger. And
      advancing towards Gunnora, he whispered in her ear. *
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman started and trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hinder me not, Gilbert," she said. "I must go with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I accompany you?" asked her grandson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no account," replied the stranger, "unless you desire to be lodged in
      the deepest dungeon in the Tower. Be at the place of rendezvous to-morrow
      night, and you shall know more. Are you ready, good dame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gunnora signified her assent; and, after a few parting words with her
      grandson, the latter unfastened a small door, opening upon the yard, and
      let them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were scarcely clear of the house, when the stranger placing a silver
      whistle to his lips, blew a call upon it, which was instantly answered by
      a couple of attendants. At a signal from their leader they placed
      themselves on either side of Gunnora, and in spite of her resistance and
      remonstrances, dragged her forcibly along. The stranger, who marched a few
      yards in advance, proceeded at so rapid a pace, that the old woman found
      it utterly impossible to keep up with him. She therefore stood still, and
      refused to take another step. But this did not avail her, for the two
      attendants seized her in their arms, and hurried forward as swiftly as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though bewildered and alarmed, Gunnora did not dare to cry out for
      assistance. Indeed, they did not encounter a single passenger in the
      streets, until, as they were descending Budge-row, they heard the clank of
      arms, and beheld the gleam of torches borne by a party of the watch who
      were approaching from Can-wick-street, or as it is now called,
      Cannon-street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning off on the right, the stranger descended Dowgate-hill, and gained
      Thames-street before he had been remarked. A short time sufficed to bring
      him to St. Mary-hill, up which he mounted, and entering Thames-street, and
      passing St. Dunstan's in the East on the right, and the ancient church of
      All Hallows Barking on the left, he reached Great Tower-hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the vapours from the river had cleared off. The stars had
      begun to peep forth, and the first glimpse of day to peer in the east. By
      this light, and from this spot, the stern and sombre outline of the Tower,
      with its ramparts&mdash;its citadel, and its numerous lesser turrets, was
      seen to great advantage. On the summit of the Hill appeared the scaffold
      and the gallows already noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pausing for a moment, and pointing to a range of buildings, the summits of
      which could just be distinguished, to the south of the White Tower, the
      stranger said&mdash;"Within that palace Northumberland now reposes,
      surrounded by a triple line of fortifications, and defended by a thousand
      armed men. But if you will only reveal all you know, ere another week has
      passed his head shall be laid on that scaffold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last time I beheld that fatal spot," returned Gunnora, "my
      foster-son, the Duke of Somerset, was decapitated there. If I can avenge
      him upon his foe, I shall die content.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obey my directions implicitly, and you <i>shall</i> do so," rejoined the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are we to enter the Tower?" asked Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not by the ordinary road," replied the other, significantly. "But we
      shall be observed if we linger here. Forward!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the Hill in the direction of the City Postern, the stranger
      suddenly wheeled round, and, under cover of a low wall, approached the
      moat. Exactly opposite the Devilin Tower, and the bastion occupying the
      north-western anglo of the exterior line of fortifications, stood at this
      time, at a little distance from the moat, a small low building. Towards
      this structure the stranger hastened. As he drew near it, he glanced
      uneasily at the ramparts, to ascertain whether he was observed. But though
      the measured tread of the sentinels and the clank of arms were distinctly
      audible, he remained unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlocking the door, the whole party entered the building, which was
      apparently deserted. After a moment's search, the stranger discovered a
      spring in the floor, which he pulled, and a trap-door opened, disclosing a
      long and steep flight of steps, at the foot of which sat a man with a
      mask, bearing a torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner did this person hear the noise occasioned by the opening of the
      trap-door, than he hastily ascended, and placed himself in readiness to
      guide the party. On gaining the level ground, it was evident, from the
      dampness of the arched roof of the passage, and the slippery surface of
      the floor along which they trod, that they were far below the bottom of
      the moat. Traversing this damp dark passage for more than a hundred yards,
      the humid atmosphere gave place to a more wholesome air, and the ground
      became drier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, the passage had been about three feet wide and seven high, and
      was arched and flagged with stone. But they had now arrived at a point
      where it became more lofty, and their further progress was checked by a
      strong door plated with iron, and studded with nails. Taking a huge key
      from his girdle, the man in the mask unlocked this ponderous door, and,
      admitting the party, fastened it behind him. He then led them up another
      stone stair-case, similar in all respects to the first, except that it did
      not ascend to more than half the height. This brought them to a vaulted
      gallery, from which three passages branched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing that on the right, and preceded by his masked attendant, the
      stranger strode silently along. As she followed him, Gunnora noticed
      several strong doors in the wall, which she took to be entrances to
      dungeons. After threading this passage, the party ascended a third short
      flight of steps, at the top of which was a trap-door. It was opened by the
      guide, and admitted them into a small stone chamber, the walls of which
      appeared, from the embrazures of the windows, to be of immense thickness.
      The roof was groined and arched. In the centre of the room stood a small
      table, on which some provisions were placed. A small copper lamp,
      suspended from the roof, threw a sickly light around, and discovered a
      little pallet stretched in a recess on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are now in the Bowyer's Tower, in the chamber where it is said the
      Duke of Clarence was drowned in the butt of malmsey," observed the
      stranger. "Here you will remain till your presence is required by the
      Council."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gunnora would have remonstrated, but the stranger waved his hand to her to
      keep silence, and, followed by his attendants, descended through the

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;HOW THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND MENACED SIMON RENARD IN SAINT
      PETER'S CHAPEL ON THE TOWER-GREEN; AND HOW QUEEN JANE INTERPOSED BETWEEN
      THEM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t will now be
      proper to ascertain how far the Duke of Northumberland was justified in
      his suspicion of Queen Jane's conduct being influenced by some secret and
      adverse counsel. After the abrupt departure of Lord Guilford Dudley for
      Sion House, as before related, she was greatly distressed, and refused at
      first to credit the intelligence. But when it was confirmed beyond all
      doubt by a message from her husband himself, declaring that he would not
      return till she had acceded to his request, she burst into tears, and
      withdrew to her own chamber, where she remained for some time alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she re-appeared, it was evident from her altered looks that she had
      suffered deeply. But it was evident also, from her composure of
      countenance and firmness of manner, that whatever resolution she had
      formed she would adhere to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoning the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke to her presence, she briefly
      explained to them that she had heard, with infinite concern and
      uneasiness, that the council had proposed to raise her husband to the
      throne, because she foresaw that it would breed trouble and
      dissatisfaction, and greatly endanger her own government.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness judges rightly," replied the Earl of Pembroke. "It will be
      said that in thus elevating his son, Northumberland seeks only his own
      aggrandisement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it will be truly said, my lord," rejoined Jane. "But if this is your
      opinion, why was your voice given in favour of the measure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No man is bound to accuse himself," replied Pembroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But every man is bound to speak truth, my lord," rejoined Jane. "Again I
      ask you, why your assent was given to this measure, which, by your own
      admission, is fraught with danger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke of Northumberland is my enemy," replied the Earl, sternly. "Had
      this step been taken it would have ensured his destruction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak frankly, my lord," rejoined the Queen. "But you forget that it
      must have ensured my destruction also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a loyal subject of your majesty," replied the Earl of Pembroke, "and
      will shed my last drop of blood in the defence of your crown. But I will
      not submit to the Duke's imperious conduct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, my lord, you owe your own dignity to him," rejoined Jane,
      sarcastically. "Sir William Herbert would not have been Earl of Pembroke
      but for the Duke's intercession with our cousin Edward. For shame, my
      lord! you owe him too much to act against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> owe him nothing," interposed the Earl of Arundel, "and may
      therefore speak without risk of any such imputation as your majesty has
      thrown out against Lord Pembroke. If the overweening power of the Duke of
      Northumberland be not checked, it will end in his downfal, and the downfal
      of all those with whom he is connected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for your counsel, my lord," replied the Queen; "and, setting
      down much to your private animosity, will place the rest to loyalty to
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness will be speedily satisfied of the truth of my assertion, if
      you refuse compliance with Northumberland's demands," replied Pembroke.
      "But you will find it, unless you have recourse to strong measures, a
      difficult and a dangerous game to play."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To one who, though so young in years, is yet so old in wisdom as your
      majesty," added the Earl of Arundel, "it will be needless to say, that on
      the first decisive movement of your reign&mdash;as on that of a battle&mdash;depends
      the victory. If you yield, all is lost. From this one step the Duke will
      estimate your character, and become either your servant or your master.
      From his conduct, also, you will know what to expect from him hereafter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My resolution is taken, my lords," returned the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The course I have resolved upon in reference to the duke, you will learn
      when I meet you in the council-chamber, where he will be present to speak
      for himself&mdash;and, if need be, defend himself. My desire is that my
      reign should begin and proceed in peace. And, if you hope for my favour,
      you will forget your differences with his grace, and act in concert with
      me. In asserting my own power, I trust I shall convince him of the
      futility of any further struggle with me, and so bring him to a sense of
      duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty may depend upon the full support of your council," rejoined
      Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it not, my lord," replied Jane. "And now to the business on which
      I summoned you. It may have reached you that my dear lord has departed
      this morning for Sion House, in great displeasure that I have refused to
      comply with his wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have heard as much," replied both noblemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My desire is that you hasten after him and entreat him to return with all
      speed," pursued Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty then consents!" exclaimed Pembroke, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, my lord," replied the Queen. "I will raise him to his father's
      rank. He shall have a dukedom, but not a kingdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would counsel your majesty to reflect ere you concede thus much,"
      observed Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said that my resolution is taken," replied the Queen.
      "Repeat what I have told you to him, and entreat him to return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Entreat</i> him!" echoed Pembroke scornfully. "It is not for your
      highness to entreat, but to command. Obedience sworn at the altar by the
      lips of the Queen of England, is cancelled as soon as uttered. Your
      husband is your subject. Empower us to bring him to you, and he shall be
      at your feet within an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My pleasure is that you literally fulfil my injunctions, my lords,"
      replied the Queen. "Lord Guilford Dudley was the husband of my choice.
      When I gave my hand to him at the altar, I had no thought that it would
      ever grasp a sceptre, Nor, till I obtained this unlooked-for&mdash;and,
      believe me, most unwished-for dignity,&mdash;did the slightest
      misunderstanding ever arise between us. But now that I am compelled to
      sacrifice my affections at the shrine of duty,&mdash;now that I am Queen
      as well as consort&mdash;and he is subject as well as husband&mdash;this
      disagreement has occurred, which a little calm reflection will put to
      rights."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if his lordship should refuse to return with us?" asked Pembroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will use your best endeavours to induce him to do so," replied Jane,
      a tear starting to her eye, and her voice faltering in spite of her
      efforts to maintain her composure. "But if you fail, I shall at least be
      satisfied that I have done my duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty's commands shall be obeyed," replied Pembroke. "But we must
      have your licence to go forth&mdash;for we are detained as prisoners
      within the Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it," replied Jane. And she immediately wrote out the
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The passport must be countersigned by the duke," said Pembroke. "The
      gate-keepers will not hold this sufficient authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How!" exclaimed Jane, reddening, "Am I not Queen? Is not my authority
      absolute here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not while the duke holds his high office, gracious madam," returned
      Pembroke. "His followers give you the <i>name</i> of Queen. But they look
      up to him as sovereign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I need no assurance that you are Northumberland's mortal enemy,"
      replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am your majesty's loyal subject," replied the earl. "And if your
      passport be respected, I will confess that I have wronged him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if it be not, I will confess I have wronged <i>you</i>, my lord,"
      rejoined Jane. "The royal barge is at your service.&mdash;An usher shall
      conduct you to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she motioned one of her train, to attend them, and the two
      nobles bowed and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they had quitted the royal presence, Pembroke observed to his
      companion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have now effected a quarrel, which will end in Northumberland's
      destruction and Jane's dethronement. Simon Renard will so fan the flame,
      that it shall never be extinguished."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Earl anticipated, the Queen's pass was refused&mdash;the warders
      declaring that their instructions were to suffer no one to go forth
      without the Duke's written order. They then returned to the palace. It was
      some time before they were admitted to the Queen, as she was engaged in
      the angry conference previously-related with her mother-in-law. When the
      Duchess had departed, they sought an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, my lords," cried Jane, turning very pale; "do I see you again so
      soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is as I informed your highness," replied the Earl of Pembroke, laying
      the order on the table. "The Duke is master here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed the Queen, starting to her feet, "am I deserted by my
      husband&mdash;braved by the Duke&mdash;and treated like an infant by his
      imperious dame? I cry you pardon, my lords, you have <i>not</i> deceived
      me. You are my loyal subjects. Oh! I could weep to think how I have been
      deluded. But they shall find they have not made me queen for nothing.
      While I <i>have</i> power I will use it. My lords, I bid you to the
      council at noon tomorrow. I shall summon Lord Guilford Dudley to attend
      it, and he will refuse at his peril."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a care, gracious madam, how you proceed with the Duke," replied
      Pembroke. "Your royal predecessor, Edward, it is said, came not fairly by
      his end. If Northumberland finds you an obstacle to his designs, instead
      of a means of forwarding them, he will have little scruple in removing
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be wary, doubt it not, my lord," rejoined Jane. "To-morrow you
      shall learn my pleasure. I count on your fidelity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty may safely do so," they replied. And with renewed assurances
      of zeal, they departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her spirit is now fairly roused," observed Pembroke, as they quitted the
      palace. "If she hold in the same mind till to-morrow, it is all over with
      Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Souvent femme varie, bien fol est qui s'y fie</i>," observed Simon
      Renard, advancing to meet them. "Let me know how you have sped."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl of Pembroke then related the particulars of their interview with
      the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All goes on as well as I could desire," observed Renard. "But she must
      come to an open rupture with him, else the crafty Duke will find some
      means of soothing her wounded pride. Be that my task."
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking their way slowly along the outer ward, the trio passed under the
      gloomy gateway of the Bloody Tower, and ascended a flight of steps on the
      left leading to the Tower Green. Here (as now,) grew an avenue of trees,
      and beneath their shade they found De Noailles, who instantly joined them.
      Renard then entered into a full detail of his schemes, and acquainted them
      with the information he had received through his messengers, in spite of
      all the Duke's precautions, of the accession in strength which Mary's
      party had received, and of the numbers who had declared themselves in her
      favour. He further intimated that his agents were at work among the people
      to produce a revolt in the metropolis.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they proceeded across the Tower-green, the Earl of Pembroke paused at a
      little distance from the chapel, and pointing to a square patch of ground,
      edged by a border of white stones, and completely destitute of herbage,
      said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two Queens have perished here. On this spot stood the scaffolds of Anne
      Boleyn and Catherine Howard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And ere long a third shall be added to their number," observed Renard,
      gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaping their course towards the north-east angle of the fortress, they
      stopped before a small turret, at that time called the Martin Tower, and
      used as a place of confinement for state offenders, but now denominated
      the Jewel Tower, from the circumstance of its being the depository of the
      regalia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Within that tower are imprisoned the Catholic Bishops Gardiner and
      Bonner,'" remarked Arundel..
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let Mary win the crown, and it shall be tenanted by the protestants,
      Cranmer and Ridley," muttered Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the others returned to the Green, Renard lingered for an instant to
      contemplate the White Tower, which is seen perhaps to greater advantage
      from this point of view than from any other in the fortress. And as it is
      in most respects unchanged,&mdash;excepting such repairs as time has
      rendered necessary, and some alterations in the doorways and windows, to
      be noted hereafter,&mdash;the modern visitor to this spot may, if he
      pleases, behold it in much the same state that it appeared to the plotting
      Spanish ambassador.

      Rising to a height of nearly a hundred feet; built in a quadrangular form;
      terminated at each angle by a lofty turret, three of which are square,
      while the fourth, situated at the northeast, is circular, and of larger
      dimensions than the others; embattled; having walls of immense thickness,
      exceeding fourteen feet, and further strengthened by broad flat
      buttresses, dividing the face of the building into compartments; lighted
      by deep semi-circular-arched windows;&mdash;this massive stronghold,
      constructed entirely of stone,&mdash;and now in some parts defaced by a
      coating of mortar and flints,&mdash;occupies an area of an hundred and
      sixteen feet on the north and south, and ninety-six on the east and west.
      At the south-east corner is a broad semi-circular projection, marking the
      situation of St. John's Chapel, already described. The round turret, at
      the north-east angle, was used as an observatory by the celebrated
      astronomer, Flamstead, in the reign of Charles the Second. The principal
      entrance was on the north, and was much more spacious than the modern
      doorway, which occupies its site.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the period of this chronicle the White Tower was connected, as has
      already been mentioned, on the south-east with the ancient palace. On the
      south stood a fabric called the Jewel-house; while at the south-western
      angle was another embattled structure of equal elevation and dimensions
      with the By-ward Tower and the other gates, denominated the Coal-harbour
      Tower. These, with the Lanthorn Tower and the line of buildings extending
      in an easterly direction towards the Broad Arrow Tower, have totally
      disappeared, and the White Tower is now disconnected with every other
      edifice. For centuries it has stood, and for centuries may it continue to
      stand! Within its walls the old monarchs of England have held their
      councils,&mdash;within its vaults prisoners have sighed,&mdash;from its
      gates queens have come forth to execution!&mdash;Long may it flourish as a
      fearful memento of the past!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the present occasion, it presented a stirring picture. From a tall
      staff, planted on the roof, floated the royal standard. Cannon bristled
      from its battlements, and armed men were seen marching from post to post
      on its platforms. Before the principal entrance four warders were
      stationed; and in front troops of arquebusiers and archers were passing
      under the review of their leaders. The sound of martial music filled the
      air; pennons and banners fluttered in the breeze; and pikes, steel caps,
      and corslets glittered in the sunbeams. Amid these warlike groups, the
      figures of the gigantic warders and their diminutive attendant, Xit,
      caught the eye of Renard, and filled him with astonishment:&mdash;the
      former being taller by the head and shoulders than the mass of their
      companions, besides far exceeding them in bulk and size of limb; while the
      latter, with more than ordinary pretensions to the dignity of manhood, had
      scarcely the stature of a child. It must not be omitted in the description
      of the White Tower that the summits of its four turrets were surmounted by
      large vanes, each decorated with a crown, in the hollows of which, as in
      our own time, the jackdaws were accustomed to build.
    </p>
    <p>
      After gazing at this magnificent structure for a few minutes, and
      indulging in the emotions which its contemplation inspired, Simon Renard
      followed his companions, and resumed his discourse. They had again
      adverted to Jane, when the door of the principal entrance of the White
      Tower was thrown open, and, attended by the Duchess of Suffolk and the
      Ladies Hastings and Herbert, the subject of their conference issued from
      it and proceeded on foot towards St. Peter's Chapel. The road was
      immediately cleared by her attendants, and the three gigantic warders and
      their tiny companion marched before her, and planted themselves on either
      side of the chapel door. Glancing significantly at his companions, Renard
      motioned them to follow him, and hurried towards the sacred pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you a rigid Catholic, M. Renard." observed Pembroke, "about to
      attend Protestant worship? Hopes may be entertained of your conversion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stronger hopes may be entertained that I shall restore the ancient
      worship," muttered Renard, as he entered the chapel, and took his place
      unobserved by the Queen behind one of the columns of the aisle, while she
      advanced to the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erected in the reign of Edward the First, the little chapel of St. Peter
      ad Vincula (the parochial church&mdash;for the Tower, it is almost
      needless to say, is a parish in itself), is the second structure occupying
      the same site and dedicated to the same saint. The earlier fabric was much
      more spacious, and contained two chancels, with stalls for the king and
      queen, as appears from the following order for its repair issued in the
      reign of Henry the Third, and recorded by Stow:&mdash;"The king to the
      keepers of the Tower work, sendeth greeting: We command you to brush or
      plaster with lime well and decently the chancel of St. Mary in the church
      of St. Peter within the bailiwick of our Tower of London, and the chancel
      of St. Peter in the same church; and from the entrance of the chancel of
      St. Peter to the space of four feet beyond the stalls made for our own and
      our queen's use in the same church; and the same stalls to be painted. And
      the little Mary with her shrine and the images of St. Peter, St. Nicholas,
      and Katherine, and the beam beyond the altar of St. Peter, and the little
      cross with its images to be coloured anew, and to be refreshed with good
      colours. And that ye cause to be made a certain image of St. Christopher
      holding and carrying Jesus where it may best and most conveniently be
      done, and painted in the foresaid church. And that ye cause two fair
      tables to be made and painted of the best colours concerning the stories
      of the blessed Nicholas and Katherine, before the altars of the said
      saints in the same church. And that ye cause to be made two fair cherubims
      with a cheerful and joyful countenance standing on the right and left of
      the great cross in the said church. And moreover, one marble font with
      marble pillars well and handsomely wrought."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus much respecting the ancient edifice. The more recent chapel is a
      small, unpretending stone structure, and consists of a nave and an aisle
      at the north, separated by pointed arches, supported by clustered stone
      pillars of great beauty. Its chief interest is derived from the many
      illustrious and ill-fated dead crowded within its narrow walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here rested, for a brief season, the body of John Fisher, Bishop of
      Rochester, beheaded in 1535, for denying the king's supremacy&mdash;"a
      prelate," says Holinshed, "of great learning and of very good life. The
      Pope had elected him a cardinal and sent his hat as far as Calais. But his
      head was off before his hat was on, so that they met not." Next to Fisher
      was interred his friend, the wise, the witty, the eloquent Sir Thomas
      More, whom Hall, the chronicler, hesitates whether he shall describe as "a
      foolish wise man, or a wise foolish man,"&mdash;and who jested even on the
      scaffold. His body was afterwards removed, at the intercession of his
      daughter, Margaret Roper, to Chelsea. Here also was interred the last of
      the right line of the Plantagenets, Margaret, Countess of Salisbury, the
      mother of Cardinal Pole. The venerable countess refused to lay her head
      upon the block, saying (as Lord Herbert of Cherbury reports),&mdash;"'So
      should traitors do, and I am none.' Neither did it serve that the
      executioner told her it was the fashion:&mdash;so turning her grey head
      every way, she bid him, if he would have it, to get it as he could: <i>so
      he was constrained to fetch it off slovenly.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here also was deposited the headless trunk of another of Henry the
      Eighth's victims, Thomas Lord Cromwell, the son of a blacksmith, who,
      having served as a common soldier under Bourbon, at the sack of Rome,
      entered Wolsey's service, and rose to be Grand Chamberlain of the realm.
      Here, in Elizabeth's reign, were brought the remains of Thomas Howard,
      Duke of Norfolk, who aspired to the hand of the Queen of Scots. And here
      also were laid those of Robert Devereux, the rash and ill-fated Earl of
      Essex. Under the communion-table was interred, at a later date, the daring
      and unfortunate Duke of Monmouth, who fell a sacrifice to his ambition.
      And to come down to yet more recent times, beneath the little gallery at
      the west of the chapel, were buried the three leaders of the rebellion of
      1745&mdash;Lords Kilmarnock, Balmerino, and Lovat.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were four other graves, which, as being more nearly connected with
      the personages introduced in this chronicle, it will be proper to notice
      separately. Before the altar, on the west, a plain flag bore the
      inscription "<i>Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, 1552</i>." On the next
      grave to that of the great Lord Protector was written "<i>Katherine Howard</i>,"
      and on the adjoining stone, "<i>Anne Boleyn</i>" These two queens,&mdash;equally
      unfortunate, but not, perhaps, equally culpable,&mdash;perished within
      five years of each other&mdash;the latter suffering in 1536, the former in
      1541. Close to the wall on the right, a fourth grave bore the name of "<i>Thomas
      Seymour, Baron Sudley</i>." Seymour was brother to the Duke of Somerset,
      and Lord High Admiral of England; and the only stain on the Protector's
      otherwise reproachless character is, that he signed his death-warrant, and
      declined to use the power he undoubtedly possessed, of procuring his
      pardon. The fiery and ambitious Admiral was beheaded in 1549.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between this grave and that of Anne Boleyn intervened a plain stone,
      unmarked by any inscription, and indicating a vacant tomb. Beneath this
      flag, eighteen months after the execution of his victim, the Duke of
      Somerset&mdash;and barely six weeks from the day on which this chronicle
      opens&mdash;was deposited the headless trunk of the once all-powerful and
      arrogant Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service over, as the Queen was about to depart, Simon Renard advanced
      to meet her. Returning his ceremonious salutation by a dignified greeting,
      Jane, with a look of some surprise, inquired the cause of his presence..
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might have chosen a more fitting season and place for an audience with
      your majesty," replied Renard, in the low and silvery tone which he could
      adopt at pleasure. "But I have that to communicate which emboldens me to
      break through all forms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Declare it then, sir," replied the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard glanced significantly at her. She understood him, and motioning her
      attendants to withdraw to a little distance, they obeyed; and Lady
      Hastings seized the opportunity of despatching a messenger to her father
      to acquaint him with the circumstance, as already related.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the nature of the disclosure made by the wily ambassador to the
      Queen, it is not our present purpose to reveal. That it was important was
      evident from the deep attention she paid to it; and it was apparent, also,
      from her changing looks and agitated demeanour, that her fears were
      greatly aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Renard proceeded, her uneasiness increased so much that she could
      scarcely support herself, and her attendants were about to hasten to her
      assistance, when a gesture from the ambassador checked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different inferences were drawn by the various witnesses of this singular
      interview. But all were satisfied of the ascendancy which Renard had, in
      some manner, acquired over the youthful sovereign. While glances of
      triumph were exchanged between the conspiring lords, who watched them from
      their station in the aisle, the greatest misgivings were experienced by
      the Ladies Hastings and Herbert. Unable to comprehend the mystery, they
      were so much struck with the peculiar expression of Jane's countenance,
      which precisely resembled the look she wore after the mysterious
      occurrence in St. John's Chapel, that they could not help thinking the
      present conference had some relation to that event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard's manner, indeed, was so extraordinary that it furnished some clue
      to the nature of his discourse. Casting off the insinuating tone and
      deferential deportment with which he had commenced, he gradually assumed a
      look and accent of command, and almost of menace. His figure dilated, and
      fixing his black flaming eye upon the trembling Queen, he stamped his foot
      upon the vacant grave on which he was standing, and said, in a voice so
      loud that it reached the ears of the listeners, "Your Majesty will never
      wear your crown in safety till Northumberland lies here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before any answer could be returned, the door of the chapel was suddenly
      thrown open, and the Duke presented himself. A momentary change passed
      over Renard's countenance at this interruption. But he instantly recovered
      his composure, and folding his arms upon his breast, awaited the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to control his indignation, the Duke strode towards them, and
      flinging his jewelled cap on the ground, drew his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Renard," he exclaimed, "you are a traitor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom, my lord?" replied Renard, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me&mdash;to the Queen," rejoined the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If to be your grace's enemy is to be a traitor, I confess I am one,"
      retorted Renard sternly. "But I am no traitor to her majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false!" exclaimed the Duke, furiously. "You are her worst and most
      dangerous enemy. And nothing but the sacred spot in which you have sought
      shelter, prevents me from taking instant vengeance upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard smiled disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace threatens safely," he said, in a taunting tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insolent!" exclaimed the Duke, roused to a pitch of ungovernable fury.
      "Draw and defend yourself, or I will strike you dead at my feet."
    </p>

    <p>
      "Put up your sword, my lord," cried Jane, throwing herself between them.
      "You forget in whose presence you stand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" exclaimed Northumberland, "I do not forget. I am in the presence of
      one who owes her authority to me&mdash;and who holds it through me. The
      same power which made you queen, can as readily unmake you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will now judge who is the traitor," observed Renard,
      sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," she replied. "I command your grace," she continued,
      authoritatively addressing Northumberland, "to quit the chapel instantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if I refuse to obey?" rejoined the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace will do well not to urge me too far," replied Jane. "Obey me,
      or take the consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they?" cried the Duke contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your arrest," said the Earl of Pembroke, laying his hand upon his sword,
      and advancing. "If his grace will not submit himself to your highness's
      authority, we will compel him to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane!" said the Duke, suddenly controlling himself&mdash;"be warned
      before it is too late. You are in the hands of those who will destroy
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary," rejoined Renard, "her majesty is in the hands of those
      who will uphold her, and destroy <i>you?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this," interposed the Queen. "If you are, what you profess
      yourselves, my faithful subjects, you will reconcile your differences."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" exclaimed the Duke. "Let M. Renard look to himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another such menace, my lord," said Jane, "and I place you in arrest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Threatened men live long," observed Renard. "I beseech your majesty not
      to place any restraint upon his grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will your highness grant me a moment's speech with you!" said
      Northumberland, sheathing his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now, my lord," replied Jane. "To-morrow, at the council, you shall be
      fully heard. And I charge you, by your allegiance, to cease all
      hostilities till then. Have I your knightly word for this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have," replied the Duke, after a moment's reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yours, M. Renard?" continued the Queen, turning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since his grace has passed his word I cannot withhold mine," replied the
      ambassador. "But I give it with reluctance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace will not fail to attend the council to-morrow," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your highness desires it I will not, undoubtedly," replied the Duke.
      "But since you decline to act upon my advice, there can be little need for
      my presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wishes&mdash;my commands are, that you attend," rejoined the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wishes <i>are</i> commands," rejoined the Duke. "I will be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," replied Jane. "M. Renard, you will accompany me to the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the ambassador was preparing to depart, he perceived Northumberland's
      cap lying at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace's hat," he observed, pointing to it. And glancing
      significantly at Jane, he added, in an audible whisper, "Would the head
      were in it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed the Duke, laying his hand upon his sword. "But you are
      safe till to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard made no reply, but with a smile of exultation followed the Queen
      out of the chapel.

    <h2>
      XI.&mdash;HOW THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND WAS PREVAILED UPON TO UNDERTAKE
      THE ENTERPRISE AGAINST THE LADY MARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t noon on the
      following day, the Council was held as appointed by the Queen. In the
      meantime, alarming intelligence having been received of the accession
      which Mary's party had obtained, it became absolutely necessary that
      immediate and decisive measures should be taken against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Lords of the Council, including the two ambassadors, Renard
      and Noailles, were assembled, and the Queen had taken her seat upon the
      throne, the Earl of Pembroke stepped forward, and thus addressed her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is with infinite concern that I have to apprise your majesty that news
      has just been brought that Sir Edward Hastings, with an army of four
      thousand men, has gone over to the Lady Mary. Five counties also have
      revolted. Your highness is already aware that the Earls of Sussex, Bath
      and Oxford, Lord Wentworth, Sir Thomas Cornwallis and Sir Henry
      Jerningham, have raised the commoners of Suffolk and Norfolk. Lord
      Windsor, Sir Edmund Peckham, Sir Robert Drury, and Sir Edward Hastings,
      have now raised those of Buckinghamshire. Sir John Williams and Sir
      Leonard Chamberlain have stirred up a party in Oxfordshire, and Sir Thomas
      Tresham another in Northamptonshire. These rebels with their companies are
      now marching towards Framlingham Castle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The revolt must be instantly checked," rejoined Jane. "An army must be
      sent against her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom will your majesty entrust its command?" inquired the Earl of
      Pembroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To one well fitted for the office,&mdash;my father, the Duke of Suffolk,"
      answered the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My advice is, that it be given to the Duke of Northumberland," said the
      Earl of Arundel. "Wherever he has carried his arms&mdash;in Scotland and
      in France&mdash;he has been victorious. The recollection of the defeat
      sustained by the rebels at Dussindale will operate in his favour. His
      grace has every recommendation for the office. Having achieved the victory
      of Norfolk once already, he will be so feared that none will dare to lift
      up a weapon against him. Besides which, I need scarcely remind your
      highness, who must be familiar with his high reputation, that he is the
      best man of war in the realm, as well for the ordering of his camps and
      soldiers, both in battle and in the tent, as for his experience and
      wisdom, with which he can both animate his army and either vanquish his
      enemies by his courage and skill, or else dissuade them (if need be,) from
      their enterprise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My voice is for Northumberland," cried Cecil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mine," added Huntingdon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all unanimous," cried the rest of the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace hears the opinion just given," said Jane. "Will you undertake
      the command?".
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," answered the Duke, bluntly. "I will shed my blood in your majesty's
      defence. But I see through the designs, of your artful council, and will
      not be made their dupe. Their object is to withdraw me from you. Let the
      Duke of Suffolk take the command. I will maintain the custody of the
      Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not suffer him to decline it," whispered Simon Renard to the Queen.
      "By this means you will accomplish a double purpose&mdash;insure a victory
      over Mary, and free yourself from the yoke he will otherwise impose upon
      you. If the Duke of Suffolk departs, and he is left absolute master of the
      Tower, you will never attain your rightful position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," replied Jane. "My lord," she continued, addressing the
      Duke, "I am satisfied that the Council mean you well. And I pray you,
      therefore, to acquiesce in their wishes and my own.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why will not your highness send the Duke of Suffolk, as you have this
      moment proposed?" rejoined Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have bethought me," replied the Queen. "And as my husband has thought
      fit to absent himself from me at this perilous juncture, I am resolved not
      to be left without a protector. Your grace will, therefore, deliver up the
      keys of the Tower to the Duke of Suffolk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, your majesty,"&mdash;cried Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will have no nay, my lord," interrupted the Queen peremptorily. "I will
      in nowise consent that my father shall leave me. To whom else would your
      grace entrust the command?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke appeared to reflect for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know no one," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your grace must perforce consent," said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your majesty commands it, I must. But I feel it is a desperate
      hazard," replied Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so desperate," whispered Pembroke to Renard,&mdash;"that he has not
      one chance in his favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Council desire to know your grace's determination?" said Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My determination is this," rejoined the Duke. "Since you think it good, I
      will go,&mdash;not doubting your fidelity to the Queen's majesty, whom I
      shall leave in your custody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is lost!" whispered Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace's commission for the lieutenantship of the army shall be
      signed at once," said Jane; "and I beseech you to use all diligence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do what in me lies," replied the Duke. "My retinue shall meet me
      at Durham House to-night. And I will see the munition and artillery set
      forward before daybreak."
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause now ensued, during which the Duke's commission was signed by the
      whole Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is his death-warrant," observed Renard to the Earl of Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is your warrant, under the broad seal of England," said the Earl of
      Pembroke, delivering it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must have my marches prescribed," replied the Duke. "I will do nothing
      without authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say you, my lords?" said Pembroke, turning to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agree at once," whispered Renard&mdash;"he is planning his own ruin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace shall have full powers and directions," rejoined Pembroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," replied Northumberland. "My lords," he continued with great
      dignity, addressing the Council, "I and the other noble personages, with
      the whole army that are now about to go forth, as well for the behalf of
      you and yours, as for the establishing of the Queen's highness, shall not
      only adventure our bodies and lives amongst the bloody strokes and cruel
      assaults of our adversaries in the open fields; but also we leave the
      conservation of ourselves, children and families, at home here with you,
      as altogether committed to your truth and fidelity. If," he proceeded
      sternly, "we thought you would through malice, conspiracy, or dissension,
      leave us, your friends, in the briars and betray us, we could as well, in
      sundry ways, foresee and provide for our own safety, as any of you, by
      betraying us, can do for yours. But now, upon the only trust and
      faithfulness of your honours, whereof we think ourselves most assured, we
      do hazard our lives. And if ye shall violate your trust and promise,
      hoping thereby of life and promotion, yet shall not God account you
      innocent of our bloods, neither acquit you of the sacred and holy oath of
      allegiance, made freely by you to the Queen's highness, who, by your own
      and our enticement, is rather of force placed therein, than by her own
      seeking and request. Consider, also, that God's cause, which is the
      preferment of his word, and fear of Papists' entrance, hath been (as you
      have heretofore always declared,) the original ground whereupon you even
      at the first motion granted your good wills and consents thereunto, as by
      your handwritings appeareth. And think not the contrary. But if ye mean
      deceit, though not forthwith, yet hereafter, Heaven will revenge the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace wrongs us by these suspicions," observed the Earl of Arundel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will say no more," rejoined the Duke, "but in this perilous time wish
      you to use constant hearts, abandoning all malice, envy, and private
      affections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubt it not," said Cecil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not spoken to you in this sort upon any mistrust I have of your
      truths," pursued the Duke, "of which I have always hitherto conceived a
      trusty confidence. But I have put you in remembrance thereof, in case any
      variance should arise amongst you in my absence. And this I pray you, wish
      me not worse good-speed in this matter than you wish yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall all agree on one point," observed Pembroke aside to Renard&mdash;"and
      that is a hope that he may never return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your grace mistrusts any of us in this matter, you are deceived,"
      rejoined Arundel, "for which of us can wash his hands of it. And if we
      should shrink from you as treasonable, which of us can excuse himself as
      guiltless. Therefore, your doubt is too far cast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray Heaven it be so," replied the Duke, gravely. "Brother of Suffolk,
      I resign the custody of the Tower to you, entreating you, if you would
      uphold your daughter's crown, to look well to your charge. I now take my
      leave of your highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven speed your grace," replied Jane, returning his haughty salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, my lord," said the Earl of Arundel, "I am right sorry it is not
      my chance to bear you company, as I would cheerfully spend my heart's
      blood in your defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Judas!" muttered the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the Council broke up, and Jane returned to the palace,
      accompanied by the Duke of Suffolk, the two ambassadors, and others of the
      conspiring nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may give each other joy," said Pembroke to Renard, as they walked
      along&mdash;"we are at last rid of Northumberland. Suffolk will be easily
      disposed of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Queen Mary shall be proclaimed in London, before tomorrow night,"
      rejoined Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Duke, attended by the Marquis of Northampton, the Lord
      Grey, and divers other noblemen, entered his barge, and proceeded to
      Durham House. On the same night, he mustered his troops, and made every
      preparation for his departure, As he rode forth on the following morning
      through Shoreditch, great crowds collected to see him pass. But they
      maintained a sullen and ominous silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The people press to see us," observed the Duke, in a melancholy tone, to
      Lord Grey, who rode by his side; "but not one saith God speed us!"

      XII.&mdash;HOW MAGOG BECAME ENAMOURED OF A BUXOM WIDOW, YCLEPED DAME
      PLACIDA PASTON; HOW HE WENT A WOOING; AND HOW HE PROSPERED IN HIS SUIT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the night of the
      Duke of Northumberland's departure, as the three gigantic warders and
      their dwarfish attendant were assembled in their lodging in the By-ward
      Tower, preparatory to their evening meal, the conduct of Magog, which had
      been strange enough throughout the day, became so very extraordinary and
      unaccountable, that his brethren began to think he must have taken leave
      of his senses. Flinging his huge frame on a bench, he sighed and groaned,
      or rather bellowed, like an over-driven ox, and rolling his great saucer
      eyes upwards, till the whites only were visible, thumped his chest with a
      rapid succession of blows, that sounded like the strokes of a
      sledgehammer. But the worst symptom, in the opinion of the others, was his
      inability to eat. Magog's case must, indeed, be desperate, if he had no
      appetite for supper&mdash;and such a supper! Seldom had their board been
      so abundantly and invitingly spread as on the present occasion&mdash;and
      Magog refused to partake of it. He must either be bewitched, or alarmingly
      ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supplied by the provident attention of the pantler and his spouse, the
      repast consisted of a cold chine of beef, little the worse for its
      previous appearance at the royal board; a mighty lumber pie, with a wall
      of pastry several inches thick, moulded to resemble the White Tower, and
      filled with a savoury mess of ham and veal, enriched by a goodly provision
      of forcemeat balls, each as large as a cannon-shot; a soused gurnet
      floating in claret; a couple of pullets stuffed with oysters, and served
      with a piquant sauce of oiled butter and barberries; a skirret pasty; an
      apple tansy; and a prodigious marrow pudding. Nor, in this bill of fare,
      must be omitted an enormous loaf, baked expressly for the giants, and
      compounded of nearly a bushel of mingled wheaten flour and barley, which
      stood at one end of the table, while at the opposite extremity was placed
      a nine-hooped pot of mead&mdash;the distance between each hoop denoting a
      quart of the humming fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all these good things were thrown away upon Magog. With some
      persuasion he was induced to take his seat at the table, but after
      swallowing a single mouthful of the beef, he laid down his knife and fork,
      and left the rest untasted. In vain Og urged him to try the pullets,
      assuring him he would find them delicious, as they were cooked by Dame
      Potentia herself:&mdash;in vain Gog scooped out the most succulent morsels
      from the depths of the lumber pie, loading his plate with gobbets of fat
      and forcemeat balls. He declined both offers with a melancholy shake of
      the head, and began to sigh and groan more dismally than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exchanging significant looks with each other, the two giants thought it
      best to leave him to himself, and assiduously addressed themselves to
      their own meal. By way of setting him a good example, they speedily
      cleared the chine to the bone. The gurnet was next despatched; and a
      considerable inroad made into the lumber pie,&mdash;three of its turrets
      having already disappeared,&mdash;when, as if roused from a trance, Magog
      suddenly seized the marrow pudding, and devoured it in a trice. He then
      applied himself to the nine-hooped pot, and taking a long deep draught,
      appeared exceedingly relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his calmness was of short duration. The fit almost instantly returned
      with fresh violence. Without giving the slightest intimation of his
      intention, he plucked his cap from his brow, and flung it at Xit, who
      chanced at the moment to be perched upon a stool stirring a great pan of
      sack posset, set upon a chafing-dish to warm, with such force as to
      precipitate him over head and ears into the liquid, which, fortunately,
      was neither hot enough to scald him, nor deep enough to drown him. When he
      reappeared, the mannikin uttered a shrill scream of rage and terror; and
      Og, who could not help laughing at his comical appearance, hastened to his
      assistance, and extricated him from his unpleasant situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the aid of a napkin, Xit was speedily restored to a state of tolerable
      cleanliness, and though his habiliments were not a little damaged by the
      viscous fluid in which they had been immersed, he appeared to have
      suffered more in temper than in any other way from the accident. While Og
      was rubbing him dry,&mdash;perhaps with no very gentle hand,&mdash;he
      screamed and cried like a peevish infant undergoing the process of
      ablution; and he was no sooner set free, than darting to the spot where
      Magog's cap had fallen, he picked it up, and dipping it in the
      sack-posset, hurled it in its owners face. Delighted with this
      retaliation, he crowed and swaggered about the room, and stamping fiercely
      upon the ground, tried to draw his sword; but this he found impossible, it
      being fast glued to the scabbard. Magog, however, paid no sort of
      attention to his antics, but having wiped his face with the end of the
      table-cloth, and wrung his bonnet, marched deliberately out of the room.
      His brothers glanced at each other in surprise, and were hesitating
      whether to follow, when they were relieved from further anxiety on this
      score by Xit, who hurried after him. They then very quietly returned to
      the repast, and trusting all would come right, contented themselves with
      such interjectional remarks as did not interfere with the process of
      mastication. In this way they continued, until the return of Xit, who, as
      he entered the room, exclaimed, with a half-merry, half-mischievous
      expression of countenance, "I have found it out&mdash;I have found it
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Found out what?" cried out both giants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is in love," replied the dwarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Magog in love!" ejaculated Og, starting. "Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall be convinced to the contrary if you will come with me,"
      rejoined Xit. "I have seen him enter the house. And, what is more, I have
      seen the lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is she?" demanded Gog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not guess," rejoined Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fair Cicely," returned the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wide of the mark," replied the dwarf&mdash;"though, I confess,
      she is lovely enough to turn his head outright. But he is not so
      moonstruck as to aspire to <i>her.</i> Had I sought her hand, there might
      have been some chance of success. But Magog&mdash;pshaw!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush!" cried Og, "I will be sworn it is Mistress Bridget Crumbewell, the
      Bowyer's daughter, who hath bewitched him. I have noted that she hath cast
      many an amorous glance at him of late. It is she, I'll be sworn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are forsworn, for it is <i>not</i> Bridget Crumbewell," rejoined
      Xit&mdash;"the object of his affections is a widow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A widow!" exclaimed both giants&mdash;"then he is lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see not that," replied the dwarf. "Magog might do worse than espouse
      Dame Placida Paston. Her husband, old Miles Paston, left a good round sum
      behind him, and a good round widow too. She has a bright black eye, a
      tolerable waist for so plump a person, and as neat an ancle as can be
      found within the Tower, search where you will. I am half disposed to enter
      the lists with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say you so," replied Og, laughing at the dwarf's presumption, "then e'en
      make the attempt. And such assistance as we can render, shall not be
      wanting; for neither Gog nor I&mdash;if I do not misapprehend his
      sentiments&mdash;have any desire that our brother should enter into the
      holy state of matrimony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, brother," rejoined Gog; "we must prevent it if possible, and I see
      not a better way than that you propose. If it does nothing else, it will
      afford us excellent pastime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me a moment," observed Xit. "If I am to play the suitor to
      advantage, I must change my dress. I will return on the instant, and
      conduct you to Dame Placida's dwelling."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he withdrew for a short space, during which he arrayed himself
      in his holiday garments. "Magog will have no chance," he observed, as he
      strutted into the room, and glanced at his pigmy limbs with an air of
      intense self-satisfaction; "the widow is already won."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she be as fond of apes as some of her sex, she is so," replied Og;
      "but widows are not so easily imposed upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two giants, who, during Xit's absence had entirely cleared the board,
      and wound up the repast by emptying the nine-hooped pot, now expressed
      themselves ready to start. Accordingly, they set out, and, preceded by
      Xit, shaped their course along the southern ward, and passing beneath the
      gateway of the Bloody Tower, ascended the hill leading to the Green, on
      the right of which, as at the present time, stood a range of buildings
      inhabited by the warders and other retainers of the royal household.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before one of these Xit stopped, and pointing to an open window about six
      feet from the ground, desired Gog to raise him up to it, The giant
      complied, when they beheld a sight that filled them with merriment. Upon a
      stout oak table&mdash;for there was no chair in the domicile sufficiently
      large to sustain him&mdash;sat Magog, his hand upon his breast, and his
      eyes tenderly fixed upon a comely dame, who was presenting him with a
      large foaming pot of ale. The languishing expression of the giant's large
      lumpish features was so irresistibly diverting, that it was impossible to
      help laughing; and the lookers-on only restrained themselves, in the hope
      of witnessing something still more diverting.

      <a href="images/0121.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Dame Placida Paston had a short plump (perhaps a little too plump, and yet
      it is difficult to conceive how that can well be,) figure; a round rosy
      face, the very picture of amiability and good humour; a smooth chin,
      dimpling cheeks, and the brightest and merriest black eyes imaginable. Her
      dress was neatness itself, and her dwelling as neat as her dress. With
      attractions like these, no wonder she captivated many a heart, and among
      others that of Magog, who had long nourished a secret passion for her, but
      could not muster courage to declare it&mdash;for, with a bluff and burly
      demeanour towards his own sex, the giant was as bashful as a shamefaced
      stripling in the presence of any of womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the tact peculiarly belonging to widows, Dame Placida had discovered
      the state of affairs, and perhaps being not altogether unwilling to
      discourage him, having accidentally met him on the Tower Green on the day
      in question, had invited him to visit her in the evening. It was this
      invitation which had so completely upset the love-sick giant. The same
      bashfulness that prevented him from making known his attachment to the
      object of it, kept him silent towards his brethren, as he feared to excite
      their ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival at her abode, Dame Placida received him with the utmost
      cordiality, and tried to engage him in conversation. But all without
      effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see how it is," she thought; "there is nothing like a little strong
      liquor to unloose a man's longue." And she forthwith proceeded to a
      cupboard to draw a pot of ale. It was at this juncture that she was
      discovered by the observers outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magog received the proffered jug, and fixing a tender look on the fair
      donor, pressed his huge hand to his heart, and drained it to the last
      drop. The widow took back the empty vessel, and smilingly inquired if he
      would have it replenished. The giant replied faintly in the negative,&mdash;so
      faintly, that she was about to return to the cupboard for a fresh supply,
      when Magog caught her hand, and flung himself on his knees before her. In
      this posture he was still considerably the taller of the two; but bending
      himself as near to the ground as possible, he was about to make his
      proposal in due form, when he was arrested by a tremendous peal of
      laughter from without, and, looking up, beheld Xit seated on the
      window-sill, while behind him appeared the grinning countenances of his
      brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ashamed and enraged at being thus detected, Magog sprang to his feet, and
      seizing Xit by the nape of the neck, would have inflicted some severe
      chastisement upon him, if Dame Placida had not interfered to prevent it.
      At her solicitation, the mannikin was released; and he no sooner found
      himself at liberty, than, throwing himself at her feet, he protested he
      was dying for her. Perhaps it might be from a certain love of teazing,
      inherent even in the best-tempered of her sex, or, perhaps, she thought
      such a course might induce Magog more fully to declare himself; but
      whatever motive influenced her, certain it is that Dame Placida appeared
      by no means displeased with her diminutive suitor, but suffered him, after
      a decent show of reluctance, to take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, the dwarf was so elated, that springing upon a chair, he
      endeavoured to snatch a kiss. But the widow, having no idea of allowing
      such a liberty, gave him a smart box on the ear, which immediately brought
      him to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this rebuff, Xit would have persevered, had not Magog,
      whose feelings were really interested, begun to appear seriously angry.
      Seeing this, he judged it prudent to desist, and contented himself with
      entreating the widow to declare which of the two she preferred. Dame
      Placida replied, that she must take a few hours to consider upon it, but
      invited them both to supper on the following evening, when she would
      deliver her answer. Having given a similar invitation to the two giants
      outside, she dismissed the whole party.

    <h2>
      XIII.&mdash;OF THE STRATAGEM PRACTISED BY CUTHBERT CHOLMONDELEY ON THE
      JAILOR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal days had
      now elapsed since Cholmondeley was thrown into the dungeon, and during
      that time he had been visited only at long intervals by Nightgall. To all
      his menaces, reproaches, and entreaties, the jailor turned a deaf ear. He
      smiled grimly as he set down the scanty provisions&mdash;a loaf and a
      pitcher of water&mdash;with which he supplied his captive; but he could
      not be induced to speak. When questioned about Cicely and upbraided with
      his perfidy, his countenance assumed an exulting expression which
      Cholmondeley found so intolerable that he never again repeated his
      inquiries. Left to himself, his whole time was passed in devising some
      means of escape. He tried, but ineffectually, to break his bonds, and at
      last, satisfied of its futility, gave up the attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, he was disturbed by the horrible and heartrending shrieks of
      the female prisoner, who had contrived to gain access to his cell. There
      was something about this mysterious person that inspired him with
      unaccountable dread; and though he was satisfied she was a being of this
      world, the conviction did not serve to lessen his fears. After making the
      dungeon ring with her cries for some time, she became silent, and as he
      heard no sound and could distinguish nothing, he concluded she must have
      departed. Just then the unlocking of a distant door and a gleam of sickly
      light on the walls of the stone passage announced the approach of
      Nightgall, and the next moment he entered the cell. The light fell upon a
      crouching female figure in one corner. The jailor started; and his angry
      ejaculations caused the poor creature to raise her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley had never beheld anything so ghastly as her countenance, and
      he half doubted whether he did not look upon a tenant of the grave. Her
      eyes were sunken and lustreless; her cheeks thin and rigid, and covered
      with skin of that deadly paleness which is seen in plants deprived of
      light; her flesh shrunken to the bone, and her hands like those of a
      skeleton. But in spite of all this emaciation, there was something in her
      features that seemed to denote that she had once been beautiful, and her
      condition in life exalted. The terror she exhibited at the approach of the
      jailor proved the dreadful usage she had experienced. In answer to his
      savage ejaculations to her to follow him, she flung herself on her knees,
      and raised her hands in the most piteous supplication. Nothing moved by
      this, Nightgall was about to seize her and drag her away, when with a
      piercing scream she darted from him, and took refuge behind Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save me!&mdash;save me from him!" she shrieked; "he will kill me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" cried the jailor. "Come with me quietly, Alexia, and you shall
      have a warmer cell, and better food."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not go," she replied. "I will not answer to that name. Give me my
      rightful title and I will follow you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your title?" asked Cholmondeley, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beware!" interposed Nightgall, raising his hand menacingly. "Beware!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heed him not!" cried Cholmondeley; "he shall not harm you. Tell me how
      you are called?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have forgotten," replied the terrified woman, evasively. "I had another
      name once. But I am called Alexia now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has become of your child?" asked Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My child!" she echoed, with a frightful scream. "I have lost her in these
      dungeons. I sometimes see her before me running and clapping her little
      hands. Ah! there she is&mdash;coming towards us. She has long fair hair&mdash;light
      blue eyes&mdash;blue as the skies I shall never behold again. Do you not
      see her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Cholmondeley, trembling. "How is she named?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She died unbaptised," replied the female. "But I meant to call her
      Angela. Ah! see! she answers to the name&mdash;she approaches. Angela! my
      child!&mdash;my child!" And the miserable creature extended her arms, and
      seemed to clasp a phantom to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alexia!" roared the jailor, fiercely, "follow me, or I will have you
      scourged by the tormentor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He dare not&mdash;he will not,"&mdash;cried Cholmondeley, to whom the
      wretched woman clung convulsively. "Do not go with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alexia," reiterated the jailor, in a tone of increased fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>must</i> go," she cried, breaking from the esquire, "or he will kill
      me." And with a noiseless step she glided after Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley listened intently, and as upon a former occasion, heard
      stifled groans succeeded by the clangour of a closing door, and then all
      was hushed. The jailor returned no more that night. When he appeared
      again, it was with a moodier aspect than ever. He set down the provisions,
      and instantly departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      While meditating upon various means of escape, an idea at length occurred
      to the young esquire upon which he resolved to act. He determined to feign
      death. Accordingly, though half famished, he left his provisions
      untouched; and when Nightgall next visited the cell, he found him
      stretched on the ground, apparently lifeless. Uttering a savage laugh, the
      jailor held the light over the supposed corpse, and exclaimed, "At last I
      am fairly rid of him. Cicely will now be mine. I will fling him into the
      burial-vault near the moat. But first to unfasten this chain."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he took a small key from the bunch at his girdle and unlocked
      the massive fetters that bound Cholmondeley to the wall. During this
      operation the esquire held his breath, and endeavoured to give his limbs
      the semblance of death. But the jailor's suspicions were aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He cannot have been long dead," he muttered, "perhaps he is only in a
      trance. This shall make all secure." And drawing his dagger, he was about
      to plunge it in the bosom of the esquire, when the latter being now freed
      from his bondage, suddenly started to his feet, and flung himself upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suddenness of the action favoured its success. Before Nightgall
      recovered from his surprise, the poniard was wrested from his grasp and
      held at his throat. In the struggle that ensued, he received a wound which
      brought him senseless to the ground; and Cholmondeley, thinking it
      needless to despatch him, contented himself with chaining him to the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessing himself of the jailor's keys, he was about to depart, when
      Nightgall, who at that moment regained his consciousness, and with it all
      his ferocity, strove to intercept him. On discovering his situation, he
      uttered a torrent of impotent threats and execrations. The only reply
      deigned by the esquire to his menaces, was an assurance that he was about
      to set free the miserable Alexia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quitting the cell, Cholmondeley turned off on the left, in the direction
      whence he imagined the shrieks had proceeded. Here he beheld a range of
      low strong doors, the first of which he unlocked with one of the jailor's
      keys. The prison was unoccupied. He opened the next, but with no better
      success. It contained nothing except a few rusty links of chain attached
      to an iron staple driven into the floor. In the third he found a few
      mouldering bones; and the fourth was totally empty. He then knocked at the
      doors of others, and called the miserable captive by her name in a loud
      voice. But no answer was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the extremity of the passage he found an open door, leading to a small
      circular chamber, in the centre of which stood a heavy stone pillar. From
      this pillar projected a long iron bar, sustaining a coil of rope,
      terminated by a hook. On the ground lay an immense pair of pincers, a
      curiously-shaped saw, and a brasier. In one corner stood a large oaken
      frame, about three feet high, moved by rollers. At the other was a
      ponderous wooden machine, like a pair of stocks. Against the wall hung a
      broad hoop of iron, opening in the middle with a hinge&mdash;a horrible
      instrument of torture, termed "The Scavenger's Daughter." Near it were a
      pair of iron gauntlets, which could be contracted by screws till they
      crushed the fingers of the wearer. On the wall also hung a small brush to
      sprinkle the wretched victims who fainted from excess of agony, with
      vinegar; while on a table beneath it were placed writing materials and an
      open volume, in which were taken down the confessions of the sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley saw at once that he had entered the torture-chamber, and
      hastily surveying these horrible contrivances, was about to withdraw, when
      he noticed a trap-door in one corner. Advancing towards it, he perceived a
      flight of steps, and thinking they might lead him to the cell he was in
      search of, he descended, and came to a passage still narrower and gloomier
      than that he had quitted. As he proceeded along it, he thought he heard a
      low groan, and hurrying in the direction of the sound, arrived at a small
      door, and knocking against it, called "Alexia," but was answered in the
      feeble voice of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not Alexia, but whoever you are, liberate me from this horrible
      torture, or put me to death, and so free me from misery."
    </p>
    <p>
      After some search, Cholmondeley discovered the key of the dungeon and
      unlocking it, beheld an old man in a strange stooping posture, with his
      head upon his breast, and his back bent almost double. The walls of the
      cell, which was called the Little Ease, were so low, and so contrived,
      that the wretched inmate could neither stand, walk, sit, nor he at full
      length within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      With difficulty,&mdash;for the poor wretch's limbs were too much cramped
      by his long and terrible confinement, to allow him to move,&mdash;Cholmondeley
      succeeded in dragging him forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you been immured here?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not," replied the old man. "Not many weeks perhaps&mdash;but to me
      it seems an eternity. Support me&mdash;oh! support me! I am sinking fast!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A draught of water will revive you," cried Cholmondeley. "I will bring
      you some in a moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he was about to hurry to his cell for the pitcher, when the old man
      checked him..
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is useless," he cried. "I am dying&mdash;nothing can save me. Young
      man," he continued, fixing his glazing eyes on Cholmondeley. "When I was
      first brought to the Tower, I was as young as you. I have grown old in
      captivity. My life has been passed in these dismal places. I was
      imprisoned by the tyrant Henry VIII. for my adherence to the religion of
      my fathers&mdash;and I have witnessed such dreadful things, that, were I
      to relate them, it would blanch your hair like mine. Heaven have mercy on
      my soul!" And, sinking backwards, he expired with a hollow groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied that life was wholly extinct, Cholmondeley continued his search
      for the scarcely less unfortunate Alexia. Traversing the narrow gallery,
      he could discover no other door, and he therefore returned to the
      torture-room, and from thence retraced his steps to the cell. As he
      approached it, Nightgall, who heard his footsteps, called out to him, and
      entreated to be set at liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do so, provided you will conduct me to the dungeon of Alexia,"
      replied the esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not found her?" rejoined the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not," replied Cholmondeley. "Will you guide me to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall eagerly answered in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The esquire was about to unlock the chain, but as he drew near him, the
      jailor's countenance assumed so malignant an expression, that he
      determined not to trust him. Despite his entreaties, he again turned to
      depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will never get out without me," said Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will make the attempt," rejoined Cholmondeley. And wrapping himself in
      the jailor's ample cloak, and putting on his cap, he quitted the dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time, he shaped his course differently. Endeavouring to recall the
      road by which Nightgall had invariably approached, he proceeded for a
      short time along the onward passage, and presently reaching a spot where
      two avenues branched off&mdash;one to the right and the other to the left,&mdash;he
      struck into the latter, and found a second range of dungeons. He opened
      the doors of several, but they were untenanted; and giving up the idea of
      rescuing the ill-fated Alexia, he began to think it time to attend to his
      own safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage he had chosen, which, like all those he had previously
      traversed, was arched and flagged with stone, brought him to a low square
      chamber, from which a flight of steps ascended. Mounting these he came to
      two other passages, and without pausing to consider, hurried along the
      first. In a short time he was stopped by a strong iron door, and examining
      the lock tried every key, but could find none to fit it. Failing to
      procure egress in this quarter, he was obliged to return, and choosing his
      course at random, struck into an avenue on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatly surprised at the extent of the passages he had tracked, he could
      not help admiring the extraordinary solidity of the masonry, and the
      freshness of the stone, which looked as if it had just come from the
      chisel. Arriving at a gate which impeded his further progress, he applied
      to his keys, and was fortunately able to open it. This did not set him
      free as he had anticipated, but admitted him into a spacious vault,
      surrounded by deep cavernous recesses, filled with stone coffins. Broken
      statues and tattered escutcheons littered the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wondering where he could have penetrated, he paused for a moment to
      consider whether he should return; but fearful of losing his way in the
      labyrinth he had just quitted, he determined to go on. A broad flight of
      stone steps led him to a large folding-door, which he pushed aside, and
      traversing a sort of corridor with which it communicated, he found himself
      at the foot of a spiral staircase. Mounting it, he came to an extremely
      narrow passage, evidently contrived in the thickness of the wall; and
      threading it, he reached a small stone door, in which neither bolt nor
      lock could be detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Convinced, however, that there must be some secret spring, he examined it
      more narrowly, and at length discovered a small plate of iron. Pressing
      this, the heavy stone turned as upon a pivot, and disclosed a narrow
      passage, through which he crept, and found himself to his great surprise
      in the interior of St. John's Chapel in the White Tower. At first, he
      thought he must be deceived, but a glance around convinced him he was not
      mistaken; and when he called to mind the multitude of passages he had
      traversed, his surprise was greatly diminished.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus musing, he heard footsteps approaching, and instantly
      extinguished the light. The masked door from which he had emerged, lay at
      the extremity of the northern aisle, and the parties (for there was
      evidently more than one) came from the other end of the chapel. Finding he
      had been noticed, Cholmondeley advanced towards them.

    <h2>
      XIV.&mdash;HOW SIMON RENARD AND THE LORDS OF THE COUNCIL WERE ARRESTED BY
      LORD GUILFORD DUDLEY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he brief and
      troubled reign of the ill-fated Queen Jane was fast drawing to a close.
      Every fresh messenger brought tidings of large accessions to the cause of
      the lady Mary, who was now at the head of thirty thousand men,&mdash;an
      army trebling the forces of Northumberland. Added to this, the metropolis
      itself was in a state of revolt. Immense mobs collected in Smithfield, and
      advanced towards the Tower-gates, commanding the warders to open them in
      the name of Queen Mary. These rioters were speedily driven off, with some
      bloodshed. But their leader, who was recognised as the prisoner Gilbert,
      escaped, and the next day larger crowds assembled, and it was feared that
      an attack would be made upon the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Northumberland, whose order of march had been prescribed by the
      council, proceeded slowly on the expedition; and the fate that attended
      him fully verified the old proverb, that delay breeds danger. An accident,
      moreover, occurred, which, while it greatly disheartened his party, gave
      additional hope to that of the lady Mary. Six vessels, well manned with
      troops and ammunition, stationed off Yarmouth to intercept Mary in case
      she attempted to escape by sea, were driven into that port, where their
      commanders were immediately visited by Sir Henry Jerningham, who was
      levying recruits for the princess, and were prevailed upon by him to join
      her standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news of this defection reached the Tower, even the warmest
      partisans of Jane perceived that her cause was hopeless, and prepared to
      desert her. The Duke of Suffolk could not conceal his uneasiness, and
      despatched a secret messenger to Lord Guilford Dudley, who during the
      whole of this trying period had absented himself, commanding his instant
      return..
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving the summons, Dudley immediately answered it in person. Jane
      received him with the utmost affection, and their meeting, which took
      place in the presence of her father, the Duchess of Northumberland, and
      the Ladies Herbert and Hastings, was deeply affecting. Lord Guilford was
      much moved, and prostrating himself before the queen, besought her
      forgiveness for his ill-advised and ungenerous conduct&mdash;bitterly
      reproaching himself for having deserted her at a season of so much peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not upbraid you, dear Dudley," rejoined Jane, "neither will I
      attempt to disguise from you that your absence has given me more anguish
      than aught else in this season of trouble. My crown you well know was your
      crown. But now, alas! I fear I have lost that which, though a bauble in my
      eyes, was a precious-jewel in yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, say not so, my queen," replied Lord Guilford, passionately. "Things
      are not so desperate as you imagine. I have letters full of hope and
      confidence from my father, who has reached Bury Saint Edmund's. He means
      to give battle to the rebels to-morrow. And the next messenger will no
      doubt bring news of their defeat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven grant it may prove so, my dear lord!" rejoined Jane. "But I am not
      so sanguine. I have despatched missives to the sheriffs of the different
      counties, enjoining them to raise troops in my defence, and have summoned
      the Lord Mayor and the city-authorities to the council to-morrow, to
      decide upon what is best to be done in this emergency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daughter," said the Duke of Suffolk, "it is my duty to, inform you that I
      have just received letters from his Grace of Northumberland, very
      different in purport from that which has reached Lord Guilford. In them he
      expresses himself doubtful, of the result of the conflict, and writes most
      urgently for further succour. His men, he says, are hourly deserting to
      the hostile camp. And, unless he speedily receives additional force and
      munition, it will be impossible to engage the enemy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is bad news, indeed, my lord," replied Jane, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have we not troops to send him?" cried Lord Guilford Dudley. "If a leader
      is wanted, I will set forth at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We cannot spare another soldier from the Tower," replied Suffolk. "London
      is in a state of revolt. The fortress may be stormed by the rabble, who
      are all in favour of Mary. The Duke has already taken all the picked men.
      And, if the few loyal soldiers left, are removed, we shall not have
      sufficient to overawe the rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," observed the Duchess of Northumberland, "you have allowed the
      council too much sway. They will overpower you. And your highness," she
      added, turning to Jane, "has suffered yourself to be deluded by the artful
      counsels of Simon Renard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simon Renard has given me good counsel," replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are deceived, my queen," replied her husband. "He is conspiring
      against your crown and life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too true," added Suffolk, "I have detected some of his dark
      practices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I assured of this," answered Jane, "the last act of my reign&mdash;the
      last exertion of my power should be to avenge myself upon him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are the guards within the Tower true to us?" inquired Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As yet," replied Suffolk. "But they are wavering. If something be not
      done to confirm them, I fear they will declare for Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the council?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are plotting against us, and providing for their own safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," said Lord Guilford Dudley, "I will not attempt to excuse my
      conduct. But if it is possible to repair the injury I have done you, I
      will do so. Everything now depends on resolution. The council are more to
      be feared than Mary and her forces. So long as you are mistress of the
      Tower, you are mistress of London, and Queen of England&mdash;even though
      the day should go against the Duke, my father. Give me a warrant under
      your hand for the arrest of the council, and the ambassadors Renard and De
      Noailles, and I will see it instantly executed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord!" she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me, my queen, it is the only means to save us," replied Dudley.
      "This bold step will confound them and compel them to declare their
      purposes. If they <i>are</i> your enemies, as I nothing doubt, you will
      have them in your power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," replied Jane. "You shall have the warrant. It will bring
      matters to an issue."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, the door of the chamber was thrown open, and an usher
      announced "Monsieur Simon Renard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right welcome, M. Renard," said Lord Guilford, bowing haughtily.
      "I was about to go in search of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," rejoined the ambassador, coldly returning the salutation. "I am
      glad to spare your lordship so much trouble,&mdash;and I am still more
      rejoiced to find you have recovered your temper, and returned to your
      royal consort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insolent!" exclaimed Lord Guilford. "Guards!" he cried, motioning to the
      attendants&mdash;"Assure yourselves of his person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Renard, laying his hand upon his sword. "You have no
      authority for this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the Queens warrant," rejoined Dudley, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person of an ambassador is sacred," observed Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The emperor, Charles the Fifth, will resent this outrage as an insult to
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take the consequences upon myself," replied Lord Guilford,
      carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness will not suffer this wrong to be done?" said Renard,
      addressing Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Renard," replied the queen, "I have reason to believe you have
      played me false. If I find you have deceived me, though you were brother
      to the emperor, you shall lose your head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will have cause to repent this step," rejoined Renard, furiously.
      "The council will command my instant release."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The order must be speedy then," replied Dudley, "for I shall place them
      all in arrest. And here, as luck will have it, are your friends the Earls
      of Arundel and Pembroke. They will attend you to the White Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he motioned to the guards to take them into custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What means this?" cried Pembroke in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means that Lord Guilford Dudley, who has been slumbering for some time
      in Sion House, has awakened at last, and fancies his royal consort's crown
      is in danger," rejoined Renard with a bitter sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is some jest surely, my lord," observed Pembroke. "The council
      arrested at a moment of peril like this! Will you provoke us to manifest
      our power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will provoke you to manifest your treacherous designs towards her
      majesty," replied Dudley. "Away with them to the White Tower! Shrewsbury,
      Cecil, Huntingdon, Darcy, and the others shall soon join you there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word before we go, gracious madam'?" said Pembroke, addressing the
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one, my lord," replied Jane. "Lord Guilford Dudley has my full
      authority for what he does. I shall hold early council to-morrow&mdash;which
      you shall be at liberty to attend, and you will then have ample
      opportunity to explain and defend yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the confederate nobles were removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is time to put an end to this farce," remarked Renard, as they were
      conducted along the gallery towards the White Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," answered Pembroke, "and my first address in the council to-morrow
      shall be to proclaim Queen Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hair-brained Dudley imagines he can confine us in the White Tower,"
      observed Renard, laughing. "There is not a chamber in it without a secret
      passage. And thanks to the jailor, Nightgall, I am familiar with them all.
      We will not be idle to-night."

    <h2>
      XV.&mdash;HOW GUNNORA BRAOSE SOUGHT AN AUDIENCE OF QUEEN JANE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>aving seen the
      rest of the council conveyed to the White Tower, Lord Guilford Dudley
      returned to the palace. While discoursing on other matters with the queen,
      he casually remarked that he was surprised he did not perceive his
      esquire, Cuthbert Cholmondeley, in her highness's train, and was answered
      that he had not been seen since his departure for Sion House. Greatly
      surprised by the intelligence, Lord Guilford directed an attendant to make
      inquiries about him. After some time, the man returned, stating that he
      could obtain no information respecting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very extraordinary," said Lord Guilford. "Poor Cholmondeley! What
      can have happened to him? As soon as this danger is past, I will make
      personal search for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought he had left the Tower with you, my dear lord," observed Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would he had!" answered her husband. "I cannot help suspecting he has
      incurred the enmity of the council, and has been secretly removed. I will
      interrogate them on the subject tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were thus conversing, an usher appeared, and informed the queen
      that a young damsel supplicated an audience having somewhat to disclose of
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better admit her, my queen," said Dudley. "She may have
      accidentally learned some plot which it is important for us to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane having signified her assent, the usher withdrew, and presently
      afterwards introduced Cicely. The young damsel, who appeared to have
      suffered much, greatly interested the queen by her extreme beauty and
      modesty. She narrated her story with infinite simplicity, and though she
      blushed deeply when she came to speak of the love professed for her by
      Cholmondeley, she attempted no concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Jane and Lord Guilford Dudley were astonished beyond measure, when
      they learned that the young esquire had been incarcerated by Nightgall;
      and the latter was about to reproach Cicely for not having revealed the
      circumstance before, when she accounted for her silence by stating that
      she had been locked within her chamber, ever since the night in question,
      by her mother. Her story ended, Dudley declared his intention of seeking
      out the jailor without delay. "I will first compel him to liberate his
      prisoner," he said, "and will then inflict upon him a punishment
      proportionate to his offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" exclaimed Cicely, bursting into tears, "I fear your lordship's
      assistance will come too late. Nightgall has visited me daily, and he
      asserts that Master Cholmondeley has quitted the Tower by some secret
      passage under the moat. I fear he has destroyed him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be so, he shall die the death he merits," replied Dudley. "You say
      that the gigantic warders, whose lodging is in the By-ward Tower, are
      acquainted with the dungeon. I will proceed thither at once, be of good
      cheer, fair damsel. If your lover is alive he shall wed you on the morrow,
      and I will put it out of Nightgall's power to molest you further. Remain
      with the queen till I return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, do so, child," said Jane, "I shall be glad to have you with me. And,
      if you desire it, you shall remain constantly near my person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is more happiness than I deserve, gracious madam," replied Cicely,
      dropping upon her knee. "And though your majesty has many attendants more
      highly born, you will find none more faithful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fully believe it," replied Jane, with a sigh. "Rise, damsel. Henceforth
      you are one of my attendants."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely replied by a look of speechless gratitude, while summoning a guard,
      Dudley proceeded to the By-ward Tower. The giants informed him they had
      just returned from Nightgall's lodging, and that he was absent. He then
      commanded them to accompany him to the entrance of the subterranean
      dungeons beneath the Devilin Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be useless to attempt to gain admission without the keys, my
      lord," replied Og; "and they are in master Nightgall's keeping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has no one else a key? demanded Dudley, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one, unless it be Gillian Mauger, the headsman," replied Xit; "I will
      bring him to your lordship, instantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he hurried off in search of the executioner, while Dudley,
      attended by the two giants, proceeded slowly in the direction of the
      Beauchamp Tower. In a short time, the dwarf returned with Mauger, who
      limped after him as quickly as a lame leg would permit. He had no key of
      the dungeon, and on being questioned, declared there was no other entrance
      to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Break open the door instantly, then," cried Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mauger declared this was impossible, as it was cased with iron, and
      fastened with a lock of great strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magog, who was standing at a little distance with his arms folded upon his
      breast, now stepped forward, and, without saying a word, lifted up a large
      block of stone placed there to repair the walls, and hurling it against
      the door, instantly burst it open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bravely done," cried Lord Guilford. "How can I reward the service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I scarcely know how to ask it of your lordship," rejoined Magog; "but if
      you could prevail upon her majesty to issue her commands to Dame Placida
      Paston to bestow her hand upon me, you would make me the happiest of
      mankind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the dame be willing, surely she does not require enforcement," replied
      Dudley, laughing; "and if not"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has half promised her hand to me, my lord," said Xit, "and your
      lordship can scarcely doubt to whom she would give the preference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has indeed a fair choice betwixt giant and dwarf I must own," replied
      Dudley. "But bring torches and follow me. More serious business now claims
      my attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will guide your lordship through these dungeons," said Xit. "I have
      often accompanied Master Nightgall in his visits, and can conduct you to
      every cell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lead on then," said Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      After traversing a vast number of passages, and examining many cells, all
      of which were vacant, they at length came to the dungeon where
      Cholmondeley had been confined. Here they found Nightgall, who at first
      attempted to exculpate himself, and made a variety of wild accusations
      against the esquire, but when he found he was utterly disbelieved, he
      confessed the whole truth. Dismissing some of his companions in search of
      the esquire, who it was evident, if the jailor's statement was to be
      credited, must have lost himself in some of the passages. Dudley was about
      to follow them, when Nightgall flung himself at his feet, and offered, if
      his life were spared, to reveal all the secret practices of the Council
      which had come to his knowledge. Dudley then ordered the rest of his
      attendants to withdraw, and was so much astonished at Nightgall's
      communication, that he determined upon instantly conveying him to the
      palace. After a long, but ineffectual search for Chomondeley, whose escape
      has already been related, Dudley contented himself with leaving Xit and Og
      to look for him; and placing Nightgall in the custody of the two other
      giants, returned with him to the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, the queen had received an unexpected visit. She
      had retired to her closet with Cicely, and was listening to a
      recapitulation of the young damsel's love affair, when the hangings were
      suddenly drawn aside, and Simon Renard stepped from a masked door in the
      wall. Surprise for a moment held her silent, and Cicely was so much
      astonished by the appearance of the intruder, and so much alarmed by his
      stern looks, that she stood like one petrified. Renard's deportment,
      indeed, was most formidable, and could not fail to impress them both with
      terror. He said nothing for a moment, but fixed his black flaming eyes
      menacingly on the queen. As she remained speechless, he motioned Cicely to
      withdraw, and she would have obeyed had not Jane grasped her arm and
      detained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not leave me!" she cried, "or summon the guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were no sooner spoken, than Renard drew his sword, and placed
      himself between her and the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have little to <i>say</i>," he observed;&mdash;"but I would have said
      it to you alone. Since you will have a witness, I am content."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Jane had recovered her confidence, and rising, she
      confronted Renard with a look as stern and haughty as his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What brings you here, sir," she demanded; "and by what means have you
      escaped from the White Tower?&mdash;Are my guards false to their trust?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It matters not how I have escaped," replied Renard. "I am come hither to
      warn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what?" asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the peril in which you stand,'" replied Renard. "You are no longer
      queen. The Duke of Northumberland has disbanded his army, and has himself
      proclaimed Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false," rejoined Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do well not to neglect my caution," replied Renard. "As yet the
      news is only known to me. To-morrow it will be known to all within the
      Tower. Fly! while it is yet time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Jane, proudly. "Were your news true, which I doubt, I would
      <i>not</i> fly. If I must resign my crown, it shall not be at your
      bidding. But I am still a queen; and you shall feel that I am so. Guards!"
      she cried in a loud voice, "Arrest this traitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the door could be opened, Renard had darted behind the arras
      and disappeared. Nor, upon searching the wall, could the attendants
      discover by what means he had contrived his escape. Soon after this, Lord
      Guilford Dudley returned, and his rage and consternation when he learned
      what had occurred was unbounded. He flew to the White Tower, where he
      found that Simon Renard, De Noailles, and the Earls of Pembroke and
      Arundel, who had been confined in a small room adjoining the
      council-chamber, had disappeared. The guards affirmed positively that they
      were not privy to their flight, and unable to obtain any clue to the
      mystery, Dudley returned in a state of great perplexity to the palace,
      where a fresh surprise awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had scarcely recovered from the surprise occasioned by Renard's
      mysterious visit, when an usher presented himself, and delivering a ring
      to her, said that it had been given him by an old woman, who implored an
      audience. Glancing at the ornament, the queen instantly recognised it as
      that she had given to Gunnora Braose, and desired the attendant to admit
      her. Accordingly, the old woman was introduced, and approaching Jane,
      threw herself on her knees before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What seek you, my good dame?" asked Jane. "I promised to grant any boon
      you might ask. Are you come to claim fulfilment of my promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, gracious lady," said the old woman, "and do not slight my
      counsel,&mdash;for what I am about to say to you is of the deepest import.
      Your crown&mdash;your liberty&mdash;your life is in danger! The Council
      mean to depose you on the morrow, and proclaim Mary queen. Call to mind
      the warning I gave you before you entered this fatal fortress. My words
      have come to pass. You are betrayed&mdash;lost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rise, my good woman," said Jane, "and compose yourself. You may speak the
      truth. My enemies may prevail against me, but they shall not subdue me. It
      is now too late to retreat. Having accepted the crown, I cannot&mdash;will
      not lay it aside, till it is wrested from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be wrested from you on the block, dear lady," cried Gunnora.
      "Listen to me, I beseech you. To-night you can make your retreat.
      To-morrow it will be too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too late already," cried a stern voice behind them, and Renard
      again presented himself. He was accompanied by the Earl of Pembroke, and
      Cholmondeley who was muffled in the jailer's cloak. "Lady Jane Dudley,"
      continued the ambassador, in an authoritative voice, "there is one means
      of saving your life, and only one. Sign this document," and he extended a
      parchment towards her. "It is your abdication. Sign it, and I will procure
      you a free pardon for yourself and your husband from Queen Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary is <i>not</i> queen,&mdash;nor will I sign it," replied Jane. "Then
      hear me," replied Renard. "In Queen Mary's name, I denounce you as an
      usurper. And if you further attempt to exercise the functions of royalty,
      you will not escape the block."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does not overrate your danger," interposed Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What make you here, old woman?" said Renard, addressing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come on the same errand as yourself," she replied, "to warn this
      noble, but ill-advised lady of her peril."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you likewise informed her why you were brought to the Tower?"
      demanded Renard, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then she shall learn it from me," continued the ambassador, "though it is
      not the season I would have chosen for the disclosure. This woman
      administered poison to your predecessor, Edward VI, by order of the Duke
      of Northumberland."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false," cried Jane, "I will not believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretch! you condemn yourself," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it," rejoined Gunnora; "but place me on the rack, and I will
      repeat the charge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What motive could the duke have for so foul a crime?" demanded the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," replied Gunnora; "he wished to remove the king so suddenly, that
      the princesses Mary and Elizabeth might have no intelligence of his
      decease. But this is not all, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What more remains to be told?" asked Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were to be the next victim," returned the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Northumberland aimed at the supreme power. With this view, he wedded you
      to his son; with this view, he procured the letters patent from King
      Edward declaring you his successor; with this view, he proclaimed you
      queen, raised you to the throne, and would have made your husband king.
      His next step was to have poisoned you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poisoned me!" exclaimed Jane, horror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, poisoned you," repeated Gunnora. "I was to administer the fatal
      draught to you as I did to Edward. It was therefore I warned you not to
      enter the Tower. It was therefore I counselled you to resign a sceptre
      which I knew you could not sustain. I saw you decked out like a victim for
      the sacrifice, and I strove to avert the fatal blow&mdash;but in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! I begin to find your words are true," replied Jane. "But if aught
      remains to me of power, if I am not a queen merely in name, I will now
      exert it. My lord of Pembroke, I command you to summon the guard, and
      arrest this traitor," pointing to Simon Renard. "I will not sleep till I
      have had his head. How, my lord, do you refuse to obey me? Hesitate, and
      you shall share his doom."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Cholmondeley threw off his cloak, and advancing towards
      the ambassador, said, "M. Simon Renard, you are the queen's prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cholmondeley!" exclaimed Renard, starting; "can it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, traitor," replied the esquire; "but I will now unmask you and your
      projects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back, sir!" cried Renard, in a tone so authoritative that all were
      overawed by it. "Lay hands upon me, and I give a signal which will cause a
      general massacre, in which none of Queen Mary's enemies will be spared.
      Lady Jane Dudley," he continued, addressing her, "I give you till
      to-morrow to reflect upon what course you will pursue. Resign the crown
      you have wrongfully assumed, and I pledge my word to obtain your pardon.
      But Northumberland's life is forfeited, and that of all his race."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think you I will sacrifice my husband, traitor?" cried Jane. "Seize him,"
      she added, to Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the young man could advance, Renard had unsheathed his sword,
      and placed himself in a posture of defence. "Lady Jane Dudley," he
      ejaculated, "I give you till to-morrow. Your own conduct will decide your
      fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call the guard," cried Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young esquire vainly endeavoured to obey this command, but he was
      attacked and beaten off by the ambassador and the Earl of Pembroke, who
      quickly retreating towards the masked door, passed through it, and closed
      it after them. At this juncture, Lord Guilford Dudley returned at the head
      of the guard. The occurrences of the last few minutes were hastily
      explained to him, and he was about to break open the secret door, when
      Nightgall said, "If I have a free pardon, I will conduct your lordship to
      the secret retreat of the Council, and unravel a plot which shall place
      them in your power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do this," replied Lord Guilford, "and you shall not only have a free
      pardon, but a great reward."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a sufficient guard with you, and follow me," rejoined Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley complied, and the party proceeded on their errand, while
      Cholmondeley remained with the queen and Cicely; and although his
      transports at beholding her again were somewhat alloyed by the perilous
      position in which Jane stood, he nevertheless tasted sufficient happiness
      to recompense him in some degree for his recent misery. Withdrawing to
      another apartment, Jane awaited in the utmost anxiety her husband's
      return. This did not occur for some hours, and when he appeared she saw at
      once, from his looks, that his search had been unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the night was passed between the queen and her consort in
      anxious deliberation. Cholmondeley was entrusted with the command of the
      guard, and after a few hours' rest and other refreshment, of which he
      stood greatly in need, he proceeded with Lord Clinton, who still
      apparently remained firm in his adherence, to make the rounds of the
      Tower. Nothing unusual was noticed: the sentinels were at their posts. But
      as Cholmondeley looked towards Tower-hill, he fancied he observed a great
      crowd assembled, and pointed out the appearance to Lord Clinton, who
      seemed a little confused, but declared he could perceive nothing.
      Cholmondeley, however, was satisfied that he was not deceived; but
      apprehending no danger from the assemblage, he did not press the point.
      Towards daybreak he again looked out in the same quarter, but the mob had
      disappeared. Meanwhile, Gunnora Braose had been conducted to the Bowyer
      Tower, and locked within the chamber she had occupied, while Nightgall was
      placed in strict confinement.

    <h2>
      XVI.&mdash;HOW THE COUNCIL DEPOSED QUEEN JANE; AND HOW SHE FLED FROM THE
      TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t length, the last
      morning which was to behold Jane queen dawned, and after an agitated and
      sleepless night, she addressed herself to her devotions, and endeavoured
      to prepare for the dangerous and difficult part she had to play. The Duke
      of Suffolk tried to persuade her to abdicate. But her husband, who, it has
      been already observed, inherited his father's ambitious nature, besought
      her not to part with the crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been dearly purchased," he urged, "and must be boldly maintained.
      Let us meet the Council courageously, and we shall triumph."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Jane assented. But it was evident from her manner she had but
      slight hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an early hour the lord mayor, the aldermen, and all the civic
      authorities who had been summoned, arrived. Cranmer and Ridley came soon
      after. The Council were then summoned, and by ten o'clock all were
      assembled, excepting the Earls of Pembroke and Arundel, Simon Renard, and
      De Noailles. As soon as Jane was seated beneath the state canopy, she
      ordered a pursuivant to summon them. Proclamation being made, a stir was
      heard at the lower end of the council-chamber, and the absentees presented
      themselves. All four advanced boldly towards the throne, and took their
      place among the Council. Jane then arose, and with great dignity and
      self-possession thus-addressed the assemblage:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lords," she said, "I have summoned you it may be for the last time, to
      deliberate on the course to be pursued to check the formidable tumults and
      rebellions that have been moved against me and my crown. Of that crown I
      cannot doubt I have lawful possession, since it was tendered me by your
      lordships, who have all sworn allegiance to me. Fully confiding,
      therefore, in your steadiness to my service, which neither with honour,
      safety, nor duty, you can now forsake, I look to you for support in this
      emergency."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a murmur arose among the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed Jane: "do you desert me at the hour of need? Do you
      refuse me your counsel and assistance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do," replied several voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Traitors!" exclaimed Lord Guilford Dudley: "you have passed your own
      sentence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, my lord," replied Simon Renard. "It is you who have condemned
      yourself. Lady Jane Dudley," he continued in a loud voice, "you who have
      wrongfully usurped the title and station of queen,&mdash;in your presence
      I proclaim Mary, sister to the late king Edward the Sixth, and daughter of
      Henry the Eighth of famous memory, Queen of England and Ireland, and very
      owner of the crown, government, and title of England and Ireland, and all
      things thereunto belonging."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save Queen Mary!" cried the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few dissentient voices were raised. But the Earl of Pembroke drew his
      sword, and cried in a loud voice, "As heaven shall help me, I will strike
      that man dead who refuses to shout for Queen Mary." And he threw his cap
      in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me," continued Renard, "and learn that resistance is in vain. I
      hereby proclaim a free pardon, in Queen Mary's name, to all who shall
      freely acknowledge her,&mdash;excepting always the family of the Duke of
      Northumberland, who is a traitor, and upon whose head a price is set. I
      require your Grace," he added to Suffolk, "to deliver up the keys of the
      Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are here," replied the Duke, pointing to Magog who bore them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you yield, my lord?" cried Lord Guilford, passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is useless to contend further," replied Suffolk. "All is lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied Jane. "My lords, I resign the crown into your hands; and
      Heaven grant you may prove more faithful to Mary than you have been to me.
      In obedience to you, my lord," she continued, addressing her husband, "I
      acted a violence on myself, and have been guilty of a grievous offence.
      But the present is my own act. And I willingly abdicate the throne to
      correct another's fault, if so great a fault can be corrected by my
      resignation and sincere acknowledgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall not abdicate it, Jane," cried Dudley, fiercely. "I will <i>not</i>
      yield. Stand by me, Cholmondeley, and these audacious traitors shall find
      I am still master here. Let those who are for Queen Jane surround the
      throne."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he glanced round authoritatively, but no one stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak!" he cried, in accents of rage and disappointment. "Are ye all
      traitors? Is no one true to his allegiance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But no answer was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are no traitors, my lord," said Simon Renard. "They are loyal
      subjects of Queen Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He speaks truly, my dear lord," replied Jane. "It is useless to contend
      further. I am no longer queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she descended from the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lords," she continued, addressing the Council, "you are now masters
      here. Have I your permission to retire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have, noble lady," replied Pembroke. "But it grieves me to add, that
      you must perforce remain within the Tower till the pleasure of her
      Highness respecting you has been ascertained."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A prisoner!" exclaimed Jane, trembling. "And my husband, you will suffer
      him to accompany me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be," interposed Simon Renard, harshly; "Lord Guilford Dudley
      must be separately confined."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot mean this cruelty, sir?" cried Jane, indignantly. "Do not sue
      for me, Jane," rejoined Dudley. "I will not accept the smallest grace at
      his hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guards!" cried Renard, "I command you, in Queen Mary's name, to arrest
      Lord Guilford Dudley, and convey him to the Beauchamp Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      The order was instantly obeyed. Jane then took a tender farewell of her
      husband, and accompanied by Cicely and Cholmondeley, and others of her
      attendants, was escorted to the palace.,
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no sooner taken her departure, than letters were despatched by the
      Council to the Duke of Northumberland, commanding him instantly to disband
      his army. And the Earl of Arundel was commissioned to proceed with a force
      to arrest him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a brave fellow who shall accompany your lordship," said Renard,
      motioning to Gilbert, who stood among his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hark'ee, sirrah!" he added, "you have already approved your fidelity to
      Queen Mary. Approve it still further by the capture of the Duke, and, in
      the Queen's name, I promise you a hundred pounds in lands to you and your
      heirs, and the degree of an esquire. And now, my lords, to publicly
      proclaim Queen Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the whole train departed from the Tower, and proceeded to
      Cheapside, where, by sound of trumpet, the new sovereign was proclaimed by
      the title of "Mary, Queen of England, France, and Ireland, Defender of the
      Faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouts rent the air, and every manifestation of delight was exhibited.
      "Great was the triumph," writes an eye-witness of the ceremony; "for my
      part, I never saw the like, and, by the report of others, the like was
      never seen. The number of caps that were thrown up at the proclamation was
      not to be told. The Earl of Pembroke threw away his cap full of angels. I
      saw myself money thrown out of the windows for joy. The bonfires were
      without number; and what with shouting and crying of the people, and
      ringing of bells, there could no man hear almost what another said&mdash;besides
      banquetting, and skipping the streets for joy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The proclamation over, the company proceeded to St. Paul's, where Te Deum
      was solemnly sung. It is a curious illustration of the sudden change of
      feeling, that the Duke of Suffolk himself proclaimed Mary on Tower Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The utmost confusion reigned throughout the Tower. Some few there were who
      regretted the change of sovereigns, but the majority were in favour of
      Mary. Northumberland in fact was so universally hated by all classes, and
      it was so notorious that the recent usurpation was contrived only for his
      own aggrandisement, that though Jane was pitied, no commiseration was felt
      for her husband or her ambitious father-in-law. Great rejoicings were held
      in the Tower-green, where an immense bonfire was lighted, and a whole ox
      roasted. Several casks of ale were also broached, and mead and other
      liquors were distributed to the warders and the troops. Of these good
      things the three gigantic warders and Xit partook; and Magog was so
      elated, that he plucked up courage to propose to Dame Placida, and, to the
      dwarf's infinite dismay and mortification, was accepted. Lord Guilford
      Dudley witnessed these rejoicings from the windows of the Beauchamp Tower,
      in which he was confined; and as he glanced upon the citadel opposite his
      prison, now lighted up by the gleams of the fire, he could not help
      reflecting with bitterness what a change a few days had effected. The
      voices which only nine days ago had shouted for Jane, were now clamouring
      for Mary; and of the thousands which then would have obeyed his slightest
      nod, not one would acknowledge him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a prince he had become a captive, and his palace was converted into a
      dungeon. Such were the agonizing thoughts of Northumberland's ambitious
      son,&mdash;and such, or nearly such, were those of his unhappy consort,
      who, in her chamber in the palace was a prey to the bitterest reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attended only by Cholmondeley and Cicely, Jane consumed the evening in
      sad, but unavailing lamentations. About midnight, as she had composed her
      thoughts by applying herself to her wonted solace in affliction&mdash;study,
      she was aroused by a noise in the wall, and presently afterwards a masked
      door opened, and Gunnora Braose presented herself. Jane instantly rose,
      and demanded the cause of the intrusion. Gunnora laid her finger on her
      lips, and replied in a low tone, "I am come to liberate you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not desire freedom," replied Jane, "neither will I trust myself to
      you. I will abide here till my cousin Mary makes her entrance into the
      Tower, and I will then throw myself upon her mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will show you no mercy," rejoined Gunnora. "Do not, I implore of you,
      expose yourself to the first outbreak of her jealous and vindictive
      nature. Queen Mary inherits her father's inexorable disposition, and I am
      well assured if you tarry here, you will fall a victim to her displeasure.
      Do not neglect this opportunity, sweet lady. In a few hours it may be too
      late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accept her offer, gracious madam," urged Cicely, "it may be your last
      chance of safety. You are here surrounded by enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how am I to escape from the fortress, if I accede to your wishes?"
      replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Follow me, and I will conduct you," answered Gunnora. "I have possessed
      myself of the key of a subterranean passage which will convey you to the
      other side of the moat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my husband?" hesitated Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not think of him," interrupted Gunnora, frowning. "He deserted you in
      the hour of danger. Let him perish on the scaffold with his false father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me, old woman," said Jane authoritatively; "I will not go with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not heed her, my gracious mistress," urged Cholmondeley, "your
      tarrying here cannot assist Lord Guilford, and will only aggravate his
      affliction. Besides, some means may be devised for his escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon what I have said, dear lady," said Gunnora. "Deadly as is the
      hatred I bear to the house of Northumberland, for your sweet sake I will
      forgive his son. Nay more, I will effect his deliverance. This I swear to
      you. Come with me, and once out of the Tower make what haste you can to
      Sion House, where your husband shall join you before the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promise more than you can accomplish," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That remains to be seen, madam," replied Gunuora: "but were it not that
      he is your husband, Lord Guilford Dudley should receive no help from me.
      Once more, will you trust me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley then seized a torch, and fastening the door of the chamber,
      on the outside of which a guard was stationed, assisted Jane through the
      masked door. Preceded by the old woman, who carried a lamp, they threaded
      a long narrow passage built in the thickness of the wall, and presently
      arrived at the head of a flight of stairs, which brought them to a long
      corridor arched and paved with stone. Traversing this, they struck into an
      avenue on the right, exactly resembling one of those which Cholmondeley
      had recently explored. Jane expressed her surprise at the vast extent of
      the passages she was threading, when Gunnora answered&mdash;"The whole of
      the Tower is undermined with secret passages and dungeons, but their
      existence is known only to few.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes' rapid walking brought them to a stone staircase, which they
      mounted, traversed another gallery, and finally halted before a low
      gothic-arched door, which admitted them to the interior of the Bowyer
      Tower. Requesting Cholmondeley to assist her, Gunnora, with his help,
      speedily raised a trap-door of stone, and disclosed a flight of steps.
      While they were thus employed, a strange and unaccountable terror took
      possession of Jane. As she glanced timidly towards the doorway she had
      just quitted, she imagined she saw a figure watching her, and in the gloom
      almost fancied it was the same muffled object she had beheld in St. John's
      Chapel. A superstitious terror kept her silent. As she looked more
      narrowly at the figure, she thought it bore an axe upon its shoulder, and
      she was about to point it out to her companions, when making a gesture of
      silence it disappeared. By this time the trap-door being raised,
      Cholmondeley descended the steps with the torch, while Gunnora holding
      back the flag, begged her to descend. But Jane did not move.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0146.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      "Do not lose time," cried the old woman, "we may be followed, and
      retaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Jane hesitated. She cast another look towards the doorway, and the
      idea crossed her, that from that very outlet she should be led to
      execution. A deadly chill pervaded her frame,-and her feet seemed nailed
      to the ground. Seeing her irresolution, Cicely threw herself on her knees
      before her, and implored her to make an effort. Jane advanced a step, and
      then paused. After remaining a moment in deep abstraction, she turned to
      Cicely, and said,&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Child, I thank you for your zeal, but I feel it is useless. Though I may
      escape from the Tower, I <i>cannot</i> escape my fate." Cicely, however,
      renewed her entreaties, and seconded by Chomondeley she at length
      prevailed. Pursuing the same course which Gunnora had taken on the night
      she was brought to the Tower by Simon Renard, they at length arrived at
      the shed at the further side of the moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are now safe," said Gunnora. "Hasten to Sion House, and if my plan
      does not fail, your husband shall join you there before many hours have
      passed."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she departed. Jane and her attendants crossed Tower Hill, from
      which she turned to gaze at the scene of her greatness, indistinctly
      visible in the gloom&mdash;and so agonizing were the thoughts occasioned
      by the sight that she burst into tears. As soon as she had recovered from
      her paroxysm of grief, they proceeded to the river side, where they
      fortunately procured a boat, and were rowed towards Sion House.

      XVII.-IN WHAT MANNER JANE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO THE TOWER OF LONDON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>unnora Braose kept
      her word. Before daybreak, Lord Guilford Dudley joined his afflicted
      consort. Their meeting was passionate and sad. As Jane ardently returned
      her husband's fond embrace, she cried&mdash;"Oh, my dear lord, that we had
      never been deluded by the false glitter, of greatness to quit this calm
      retreat! Oh that we may be permitted to pass the remainder of our days
      here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not yet abandoned all hopes of the throne," replied Dudley. "Our
      fortunes may be retrieved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," returned Jane, gravely&mdash;"never so far as I am concerned.
      Were the crown to be again offered to me&mdash;were I assured I could
      retain it, I would not accept it. No, Dudley, the dream of ambition is
      over; and I am fully sensible of the error I have committed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, my queen, for I will still term you so," rejoined Dudley&mdash;"but
      if my father is in arms, I will join him, and we will make one last effort
      for the prize, and regain it, or perish in the attempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wild ambition will lead you to the scaffold&mdash;and will conduct
      me there, also," replied Jane. "If we could not hold the power when it was
      in our own hands&mdash;how can you hope to regain it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is <i>not</i> lost&mdash;I will not believe it, till I am certified
      under my father's own hand that he has abandoned the enterprise," rejoined
      Dudley. "You know him not, Jane. With five thousand men at his command&mdash;nay,
      with a fifth of that number, he is more than a match for all his enemies.
      We shall yet live to see him master of the Tower&mdash;of this rebellious
      city, we shall yet see our foes led to the scaffold. And if I see the
      traitors, Renard, Pembroke and Arundel, conducted thither I will excuse
      Fortune all her malice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forgive them their treason as I forgive them!" exclaimed Jane.
      "But I fear their enmity will not be satisfied till they have brought us
      to the block to which you would doom them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is not a season for reproaches, Jane," said Dudley, coldly; "but if
      you had not trusted that false traitor, Renard,&mdash;if you had not
      listened to his pernicious counsels,&mdash;if you had not refused my suit
      for the crown, and urged my father to undertake the expedition against
      Mary,&mdash;all had been well. You had been queen&mdash;and I king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your reproaches are deserved, Dudley," replied Jane, "and you cannot
      blame me more severely than I blame myself. Nevertheless, had I acceded to
      your desires,&mdash;had I raised you to the sovereignty,&mdash;had I
      turned a deaf ear to Renard's counsel, and not suffered myself to be duped
      by his allies Arundel and Pembroke,&mdash;had I retained your father in
      the Tower,&mdash;my reign would not have been of much longer duration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you, madam," said Lord Guilford, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be plain, then," replied Jane,&mdash;"for disguise is useless now&mdash;I
      am satisfied that your father aimed at the crown himself,&mdash;that I was
      merely placed on the throne to prepare it for him,&mdash;and that when the
      time arrived, he would have removed me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane!" exclaimed her husband, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have patience, dear Dudley!" she rejoined. "I say not this to rouse your
      anger, or to breed further misunderstanding between us. Heaven knows we
      have misery enough to endure without adding to it. I say it to reconcile
      you to your lot. I say it to check the spirit of ambition which I find is
      yet smouldering within your bosom. I say it to prevent your joining in any
      fresh attempt with your father, which will assuredly end in the
      destruction of both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have brought a charge so foul against him, madam," cried her
      husband, "that as his son, I am bound to tell you you are grievously in
      error."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley," replied Jane, firmly, "I have proofs that the Duke poisoned my
      cousin, King Edward. I have proofs also, that he would have poisoned me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false," cried her husband, furiously&mdash;"it is a vile calumny
      fabricated by his enemies. You have been imposed upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, my lord," cried Gunnora Braose, who had been an unseen listener
      to the conversation. "It is no calumny. The royal Edward was poisoned by
      me at your 'father's instigation. And you and your consort would have
      shared the same fate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "False hag! thou liest," cried Lord Guilford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read that," replied Gunnora, placing a document in his hands. "It is my
      order in the Duke's own writing. Do you credit me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley hastily cast his eyes over the scroll. His countenance fell, and
      the paper dropped from his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now hear my news," continued the old woman, with a smile of
      exultation. "Your father has proclaimed Queen Mary at Cambridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" cried Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you it is true," replied Gunnora&mdash;"a messenger arrived at
      midnight with the tidings, and it was during the confusion created by the
      intelligence that I contrived to effect your escape. The Earl of Arundel
      is despatched to arrest him, and, ere to-morrow night, he will be lodged
      within the Tower. Yes," she continued with a ferocious laugh&mdash;"I
      shall see him placed in the same dungeon in which he lodged my foster-son,
      the great Duke of Somerset. I shall see his head stricken off by the same
      axe, and upon the same scaffold, and I shall die content."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrible!" cried Jane. "Leave us, wretched woman. Your presence adds to
      my affliction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will leave you, dear lady," replied Gunnora&mdash;"but though absent
      from you, I will not fail to watch over you. I have powerful friends
      within the Tower, and if any ill be designed you, I will give you timely
      warning. Farewell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A miserable and anxious day was passed by Jane and her husband. Lord
      Guilford would fain have departed with Chol-mondeley to join his father at
      Cambridge, but suffered himself to be dissuaded from the rash undertaking,
      by the tears and entreaties of his consort. As to Cicely and her lover,
      their sympathies were so strongly excited for the distresses of Jane, that
      the happiness they would otherwise have experienced in each other's
      society, was wholly destroyed. At night, as the little party were
      assembled, Gunnora Braose again made her appearance, and her countenance
      bespoke that some new danger was at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ill tidings do you bring?" cried Dudley, starting to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fly!" exclaimed Gunnora. "You have not a moment to lose. Simon Renard has
      discovered your retreat, and Lord Clinton, with a body of men, is
      hastening hither to convey you to the Tower. Fly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither?" exclaimed Lord Guilford. "Whither shall we fly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is useless, my dear lord," replied Jane, calmly, "to contend further.
      I resign myself to the hands of Providence, and I counsel you to do the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come then with me, Cholmondeley," cried Dudley, snatching up his cloak,
      and girding on his sword, "we will to horse at once, and join my father at
      Cambridge. If he has a handful of men left we can yet make a gallant
      defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke is arrested, and on his way to the Tower," said Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Dudley, "when did this occur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yesterday," replied the old woman. "He was taken within his chamber by my
      grandson, Gilbert Pot, who has received a hundred pounds in lands, and the
      degree of an esquire, for the deed. He submitted himself to the Earl of
      Arundel, and his deportment was as abject as it formerly was arrogant.
      When he saw the Earl, he fell on his knees, and desired him to have pity
      on him for the love of God. 'Consider.' he said, 'I have done nothing but
      by the order of you and the whole Council.' Then the Earl of Arundel
      replied, 'I am sent hither by the Queen's majesty, and in her name I
      arrest you.' 'And I obey it, my lord.' answered the Duke. 'I beseech you
      use mercy towards me, knowing the case as it is.' 'My lord,' rejoined the
      Earl, 'you should have sought mercy sooner. I must do according to my
      commandment. You are my prisoner!' And he committed him in charge to my
      grandson and others of the guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How learnt you this?" inquired Lord Guilford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From a messenger who has just arrived at the Tower," replied the old
      woman&mdash;"and this is the last act of the great Duke of Northumberland.
      We shall soon see how he comports himself on the scaffold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begone," cried Jane, "and do not stay here to deride our misery.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not come hither to deride it," replied the old woman, "but to warn
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for your solicitude," replied Jane&mdash;"but, it is
      needless. Retire all of you, I entreat, and leave me with my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her injunctions were immediately complied with, and her attendants
      withdrew. The unfortunate pair were not, however, allowed much time for
      conversation. Before they had been many minutes alone, the door was burst
      open, and a troop of armed men headed by Lord Clinton, the lieutenant of
      the Tower, rushed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of your errand, my lord," said Jane; "you are come to convey
      me to the Tower. I am ready to attend you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," replied Lord Clinton. "If you have any preparations to make,
      you shall have time for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have none, my lord," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," replied Lord Guilford.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sole request is, that I may take one female attendant with me," said
      Jane, pointing to Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry I cannot comply with the request," answered Lord Clinton, "but
      my orders are peremptory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will my esquire be permitted to accompany me?" inquired Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he chooses to incur the risk of so doing, assuredly," replied Clinton.
      "But he will go into captivity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will follow my Lord Guilford to death," cried Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a faithful esquire, indeed!" observed Lord Clinton, with a slight
      sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Cicely hastily threw a surcoat of velvet over her
      mistress's shoulders, to protect her from the night air, and then
      prostrating herself before her, clasped her hand, and bedewed it with
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rise, child," said Jane, raising her and embracing her&mdash;"Farewell!
      may you be speedily united to your lover, and may your life be happier
      than that of your unfortunate mistress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My barge awaits you at the stairs," observed Lord Clinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will follow you, my lord," said Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning upon Cicely, Jane, who was scarcely able to support herself, was
      placed in the stern of the boat. Her husband took his seat near her, and
      two men-at-arms, with drawn swords, were stationed as a guard on either
      side of them. Bidding a hasty adieu to the weeping Cicely, Cholmondeley
      sprang into the boat, and was followed by Clinton, who immediately gave
      the signal to the rowers. Cicely lingered till the bark disappeared, and
      as two halberdiers bearing torches were placed in the fore part of the
      vessel, she was enabled to track its course far down the river. When the
      last glimmer of light vanished, her heart died within her, and she
      returned to indulge her grief in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the boat with its unhappy occupants pursued a rapid course. The
      tide being in their favour they shortly reached London, and as they swept
      past Durham House&mdash;whence, only twelve days ago, she had proceeded in
      so much pomp to the Tower&mdash;Jane's feelings became too poignant almost
      for endurance. The whole pageant rose before her in all its splendour.
      Again she heard the roar of the cannon announcing her departure. Again she
      beheld the brilliant crowd of proud nobles, gaily-dressed cavaliers,
      lovely and high-born dames, grave prelates, judges and ambassadors. Again
      she beheld the river glistening with golden craft. Again she heard the
      ominous words of Gunnora, '<i>Go not to the Tower!</i>' Again she beheld
      the fierce lightning flash, again heard the loud thunder roll&mdash;and
      she felt she had received a deep and awful warning. These thoughts
      affected her so powerfully, that she sank half fainting on her husband's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this state she continued till they had shot London Bridge, and the
      first object upon which her gaze rested, when she opened her eyes, was the
      Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here again other harrowing recollections arose. How different was the
      present, from her former entrance into the fortress! Then a deafening roar
      of ordnance welcomed her. Then all she passed saluted her as Queen. Then
      drawbridges were lowered, gates opened, and each vied with the other to
      show her homage. Then a thousand guards attended her. Then allegiance was
      sworn&mdash;fidelity vowed&mdash;but how kept? Now all was changed. She
      was brought a prisoner to the scene of her former grandeur, unattended,
      unnoted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Striving to banish these reflections, which, in spite of her efforts,
      obtruded themselves upon her, she strained her gaze to discover through
      the gloom the White Towrer, but could discern nothing but a sombre mass
      like a thunder-cloud. St. Thomas's, or Traitor's Tower was, however,
      plainly distinguishable, as several armed men carrying flambeaux were
      stationed on its summit.

    <p>
      The boat was now challenged by the sentinels&mdash;merely as a matter of
      form, for its arrival was expected,&mdash;and almost before the answer
      could be returned by those on board, a wicket, composed of immense beams
      of wood, was opened, and the boat shot beneath the gloomy arch. Never had
      Jane experienced a feeling of such horror as now assailed her&mdash;and if
      she had been crossing the fabled Styx she could not have felt greater
      dread. Her blood seemed congealed within her veins as she gazed around.
      The lurid light of the torches fell upon the black dismal arch&mdash;upon
      the slimy walls, and upon the yet blacker tide. Nothing was heard but the
      sullen ripple of the water, for the men had ceased rowing, and the boat
      impelled by their former efforts soon struck against the steps. The shock
      recalled Jane to consciousness. Several armed figures bearing torches were
      now seen to descend the steps. The customary form of delivering the
      warrant, and receiving an acknowledgement for the bodies of the prisoners
      being gone through, Lord Clinton, who stood upon the lowest step,
      requested Jane to disembark. Summoning all her resolution, she arose, and
      giving her hand to the officer, who stood with a drawn sword beside her,
      was assisted by him and a warder to land. Lord Clinton received her as she
      set foot on the step. By his aid she slowly ascended the damp and slippery
      steps, at the summit of which, two personages were standing, whom she
      instantly recognised as Renard and De Noailles. The former regarded her
      with a smile of triumph, and said in a tone of bitter mockery as she
      passed him&mdash;"So&mdash;Epiphany is over. The Twelfth Day Queen has
      played her part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said Jane, turning disdainfully from him to Lord Clinton&mdash;"will
      it please you to conduct me to my lodging?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What he! warders," cried Lord Clinton, addressing the gigantic brethren
      who were standing near&mdash;"Conduct Lady Jane Dudley to Master
      Partridge's dwelling till her chamber within the Brick Tower is prepared.
      Lord Guilford Dudley must be taken to the Beauchamp Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we to be separated?" cried Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such are the Queen's commands," replied Lord Clinton, in a tone of deep
      commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Queen's!" exclaimed Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! the Queen's!" repeated Renard. "Queen Mary of England, whom Heaven
      long preserve!"

      ARY made her public entry into the city of London, on the 3d of August,
      1553. The most magnificent preparations were made for her arrival, and as
      the procession of the usurper&mdash;for such Jane was now universally
      termed,&mdash;to the Tower, had been remarkable for its pomp and
      splendour, it was determined, on the present occasion, to surpass it. The
      Queen's entrance was arranged to take place at Aldgate, and the streets
      along which she was to pass were covered with fine gravel from thence to
      the Tower, and railed on either side. Within the rails stood the crafts of
      the city, in the dresses of their order; and at certain intervals were
      stationed the officers of the guard and their attendants, arrayed in
      velvet and silk, and having great staves in their hands to keep off the
      crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hung with rich arras, tapestry, carpets, and, in some instances, with
      cloths of tissue gold and velvet, the houses presented a gorgeous
      appearance. Every window was filled with richly-attired dames, while the
      roofs, walls, gables, and steeples, were crowded with curious spectators.
      The tower of the old church of Saint Botolph, the ancient walls of the
      city, westward as far as Bishopgate, and eastward to the Tower postern,
      were thronged with beholders. Every available position had its occupant.
      St. Catherine Coleman's in Fenchurch Street&mdash;for it was decided that
      the royal train was to make a slight detour&mdash;Saint Dennis Backchurch;
      Saint Benedict's; All Hallows, Lombard Street; in short, every church, as
      well as every other structure, was covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, who had passed the previous night at Bow, set forth at noon,
      and in less than an hour afterwards, loud acclamations, and still louder
      discharges of ordnance, announced her approach. The day was as magnificent
      as the spectacle&mdash;the sky was deep and cloudless, and the sun shone
      upon countless hosts of bright and happy faces. At the bars without
      Aldgate, on the Whitechapel road, Queen Mary was met by the Princess
      Elizabeth, accompanied by a large cavalcade of knights and dames. An
      affectionate greeting passed between the royal sisters, who had not met
      since the death of Edward, and the usurpation of Jane, by which both their
      claims to the throne had been set aside. But it was noted by those who
      closely observed them, that Mary's manner grew more grave as Elizabeth
      rode by her side. The Queen was mounted upon a beautiful milk-white
      palfrey, caparisoned in crimson velvet, fringed with golden thread. She
      was habited in a robe of violet-coloured velvet, furred with powdered
      ermine, and wore upon her head a caul of cloth of tinsel set with pearls,
      and above this a massive circlet of gold covered with gems of inestimable
      value. Though a contrary opinion is generally entertained, Mary was not
      without some pretension to beauty. Her figure was short and slight, but
      well proportioned; her complexion rosy and delicate; and her eyes bright
      and piercing, though, perhaps, too stern in their expression. Her mouth
      was small, with thin compressed lips, which gave an austere and morose
      character to an otherwise-pleasing face. If she had not the commanding
      port of her father, Henry the Eighth, nor the proud beauty of her mother,
      Catherine of Arragon, she inherited sufficient majesty and grace from them
      to well fit her for her lofty station.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one has suffered more from misrepresentation than this queen. Not only
      have her failings been exaggerated, and ill qualities, which she did not
      possess, attributed to her, but the virtues that undoubtedly belonged to
      her, have been denied her. A portrait, perhaps too flatteringly coloured,
      has been left of her by Michele, but still it is nearer the truth than the
      darker presentations with which we are more familiar. "As to the more
      important qualities of her mind, with a few trifling exceptions, (in
      which, to speak the truth, she is like other women, since besides being
      hasty and somewhat resentful, she is rather more parsimonious and miserly
      than is fitting a munificent and liberal sovereign,) she has in other
      respects no notable imperfection, and in some things she is without equal;
      for not only she is endowed with a spirit beyond other women who are
      naturally timid, but is so courageous and resolute that no adversity nor
      danger ever caused her to betray symptoms of pusillanimity. On the
      contrary, she has ever preserved a greatness of mind and dignity that is
      admirable, knowing as well what is due to the rank she holds as the wisest
      of her councillors, so that in her conduct and proceedings during the
      whole of her life, it cannot be denied she has always proved herself to be
      the offspring of a truly royal stock. Of her humility, piety, and
      observance of religious duties, it is unnecessary to speak, since they are
      well known, and have been proved by sufferings little short of martyrdom;
      so that we may truly say of her with the Cardinal, that amidst the
      darkness and obscurity which overshadowed this kingdom, she remained like
      a faint flame strongly agitated by winds which strove to extinguish it,
      but always kept alive by her innocence and true faith, in order that she
      might one day shine to the world, as she now does." Other equally strong
      testimonies to her piety and virtue might be adduced. By Camden she is
      termed a "lady never sufficiently to be praised for her sanctity, charity,
      and liberality." And by Bishop Godwin&mdash;"a woman truly pious, benign,
      and of most chaste manners, and to be lauded, if <i>you do not regard her
      failure in religion</i>." It was this "failure in religion" which has
      darkened her in the eyes of her Protestant posterity. With so many good
      qualities it is to be lamented that they were overshadowed by bigotry.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mary did not possess the profound learning of Lady Jane Grey, she
      possessed more than ordinary mental acquirements. A perfect mistress of
      Latin, French, Spanish and Italian, she conversed in the latter language
      with fluency. She had extraordinary powers of eloquence when roused by any
      great emotion, and having a clear logical understanding, was well fitted
      for argument. Her courage was undaunted; and she possessed much of the
      firmness of character&mdash;obstinacy it might perhaps be termed, of her
      father. In the graceful accomplishment of the dance, she excelled, and was
      passionately fond of music, playing with skill on three instruments, the
      virginals, the regals, and the lute. She was fond of equestrian exercise,
      and would often indulge in the chace. She revived all the old sports and
      games which had been banished as savouring of mummery by the votaries of
      the reformed faith. One of her sins in their eyes was a fondness for rich
      apparel. In the previous reign female attire was remarkable for its
      simplicity. She introduced costly stuffs, sumptuous dresses, and French
      fashions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In personal attractions the Princess Elizabeth far surpassed her sister.
      She was then in the bloom of youth, and though she could scarcely be
      termed positively beautiful, she had a very striking appearance, being
      tall, portly, with bright blue eyes, and exquisitely formed hands, which
      she took great pains to display.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Elizabeth had taken her place behind the Queen, the procession
      set forward. The first part of the cavalcade consisted of gentlemen clad
      in doublets of blue velvet, with sleeves of orange and red, mounted on
      chargers trapped with close housings of blue sarsenet powdered with white
      crosses. After them rode esquires and knights, according to their degree,
      two and two, well mounted, and richly apparelled in cloth of gold, silver,
      or embroidered velvet, "fresh and goodlie to behold." Then came the
      trumpeters, with silken pennons fluttering from their clarions, who did
      their devoir gallantly. Then a litter covered with cloth of gold, drawn by
      richly-caparisoned horses, and filled by sumptuously-apparelled dames.
      Then an immense retinue of nobles, knights, and gentlemen, with their
      attendants, all dressed in velvets, satins, taffeties, and damask of all
      colours, and of every device and fashion&mdash;there being no lack of
      cloths of tissue, gold, silver, embroidery, or goldsmith's work. Then came
      forty high-born damsels mounted on steeds, trapped with red velvet,
      arrayed in gowns and kirtles of the same material. Then followed two other
      litters covered with red satin. Then came the Queen's body guard of
      archers, clothed in scarlet, bound with black velvet, bearing on their
      doublets a rose woven in gold, under which was an imperial crown. Then
      came the judges; then the doctors; then the bishops; then the council;
      and, lastly, the knights of the Bath in their robes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the Queen rode six lords, bare-headed, four of whom carried golden
      maces. Foremost amongst these rode the Earls of Pembroke and Arundel,
      bearing the arms and crown. They were clothed in robes of tissue,
      embroidered with roses of fine gold, and each was girt with a baldrick of
      massive gold. Their steeds were trapped in burnt silver, drawn over with
      cords of green silk and gold, the edges of their apparel being fretted
      with gold and damask. The Queen's attire has been already described. She
      was attended by six lacqueys habited in vests of gold, and by a female
      attendant in a grotesque attire, whom she retained as her jester, and who
      was known among her household by the designation of Jane the Fool. The
      Princess Elizabeth followed, after whom came a numerous guard of archers
      and arquebussiers. The retinue was closed by the train of the ambassadors,
      Noailles and Renard. A loud discharge of ordnance announced the Queen's
      arrival at Aldgate. This was immediately answered by the Tower guns, and a
      tremendous and deafening shout rent the air. Mary appeared greatly
      affected by this exhibition of joy, and as she passed under the ancient
      gate which brought her into the city, and beheld the multitudes assembled
      to receive her, and heard their shouts of welcome, she was for a moment
      overcome by her feelings. But she speedily recovered herself, and
      acknowledged the stunning cries with a graceful inclination of her person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a stage on the left, immediately within the gate, stood a large
      assemblage of children, attired like wealthy merchants, one of whom&mdash;who
      represented the famous Whittington&mdash;pronounced an oration to the
      Queen, to which she vouchsafed a gracious reply. Before this stage was
      drawn up a little phalanx, called the "Nine children of honour." These
      youths were clothed in velvet, powdered with flowers-de-luce, and were
      mounted on great coursers, each of which had embroidered on its housing a
      scutcheon of the Queen's title&mdash;as of England, France, Gascony,
      Guienne, Normandy, Anjou, Cornwall, Wales and Ireland. As soon as the
      oration was ended, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs, and their officers
      and attendants, rode forth to welcome the Queen to the city. The Lord
      Mayor was clothed in a gown of crimson velvet, decorated with the collar
      of SS., and carried the mace. He took his place before the Earl of
      Arundel, and after some little delay the cavalcade was again set in
      motion. First marched the different civic crafts, with bands of minstrelsy
      and banners; then the children who had descended from the stage; then the
      nine youths of honour; then the city guard; and then the Queen's cavalcade
      as before described.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was everywhere received with the loudest demonstrations of joy.
      Prayers, wishes, welcomings, and vociferations attended her progress.
      Nothing was heard but "God save your highness&mdash;God send you a long
      and happy reign." To these cries, whenever she could make herself heard,
      the Queen rejoined, "God save you, all my people. I thank you with all my
      heart." Gorgeous pageants were prepared at every corner. The conduits ran
      wine. The crosses and standards in the city wore newly painted and
      burnished. The bells pealed, and loud-voiced cannon roared. Triumphal
      arches covered with flowers, and adorned with banners, targets, and rich
      stuffs, crossed the streets. Largesse was showered among the crowd with a
      liberal hand, and it was evident that Mary's advent was hailed on all
      hands as the harbinger of prosperity. The train proceeded along Fenchurch
      Street, where was a "marvellous cunning' pageant, representing the
      fountain of Helicon, made by the merchants of the Stillyard; the fountain
      ran abundantly-racked Rhenish wine till night." At the corner of
      Gracechurch Street there was another pageant, raised to a great height, on
      the summit of which were four pictures; above these stood an angel robed
      in green, with a trumpet to its mouth, which was sounded at the Queen's
      approach, to the "great marvelling of many ignorant persons." Here she was
      harangued by the Recorder; after which the Chamberlain presented her with
      a purse of cloth of gold, containing a thousand marks. The purse she
      graciously received, but the money she distributed among the assemblage.
      At the corner of Gracechurch Street another stage was erected. It was
      filled with the loveliest damsels that could be found, with their hair
      loosened and floating over their shoulders, and carrying large branches of
      white wax. This was by far the prettiest spectacle she had witnessed, and
      elicited Mary's particular approbation. Her attention, however, was
      immediately afterwards attracted to the adjoining stage, which was filled
      with Romish priests in rich copes, with crosses and censers of silver,
      which they waved as the Queen approached, while an aged prelate advanced
      to pronounce a solemn benediction upon her. Mary immediately dismounted,
      and received it on her knees. This action was witnessed with some dislike
      by the multitude, and but few shouts were raised as she again mounted her
      palfrey. But it was soon forgotten, and the same cheers that had hitherto
      attended her accompanied her to the Tower. Traversing East-cheap, which
      presented fresh crowds, and offered fresh pageants to her view, she
      entered Tower Street, where she was welcomed by larger throngs than
      before, and with greater enthusiasm than ever. In this way she reached
      Tower Hill, where a magnificent spectacle burst upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast area of Tower Hill was filled with spectators. The crowds who had
      witnessed her entrance into the city had now flocked thither, and every
      avenue had poured in its thousands, till there was not a square inch of
      ground unoccupied. Many were pushed into the moat, and it required the
      utmost exertion of the guards, who were drawn out in lines of two deep, to
      keep the road which had been railed and barred from the end of Tower
      Street to the gates of the fortress clear for the Queen. As Mary's eye
      ranged over this sea of heads&mdash;as she listened to their stunning
      vociferations, and to the loud roar of the cannon which broke from every
      battlement in the Tower, her heart swelled with exultation. It was an
      animating spectacle. The day, it has been said, was bright and beautiful.
      The sun poured down its rays upon the ancient fortress, which had so
      lately opened its gates to an usurper, but which now like a heartless rake
      had cast off one mistress to take another. The whole line of ramparts on
      the west was filled with armed men. On the summit of the White Tower
      floated her standard, while bombard and culverin kept up a continual roar
      from every lesser tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      After gazing for a few moments in the direction of the lofty citadel, now
      enveloped in the clouds of smoke issuing from the ordnance, and, excepting
      its four tall turrets and its standard, entirely hidden from view, her
      eyes followed the immense cavalcade, which, like a swollen current, was
      pouring its glittering tide beneath the arch of the Bulwark Gate; and as
      troop after troop disappeared, and she gradually approached the fortress,
      she thought she had never beheld a sight so grand and inspiriting.
      Flourishes of trumpets, almost lost in the stunning acclamations of the
      multitude, and the thunder of artillery, greeted her arrival at the Tower.
      Her entrance was conducted with much ceremony. Proceeding through
      closely-serried ranks of archers and arquebussiers, she passed beneath the
      Middle Gate and across the bridge. At the By-ward Tower she was received
      by Lord Clinton and a train of nobles. On either side of the gate, stood
      Gog and Magog. Both giants made a profound obesiance as she passed. A few
      steps further, her course was checked by. Og and Xit. Prostrating himself
      before her, the elder giant assisted his diminutive companion to clamber
      upon his back, and as soon as he had gained this position, the dwarf knelt
      down, and offered the keys of the fortress to the Queen. Mary was much
      diverted at the incident, nor was she less surprised at the vast size of
      Og and his brethren&mdash;than at the resemblance they presented to her
      royal father. Guessing what was passing through her mind, and regardless
      of consequences as of decorum, Xit remarked,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty, I perceive, is struck with the likeness of my worthy friend
      Og to your late sire King Henry VIII., of high and renowned memory. You
      will not, therefore, be surprised, when I inform you that he is his&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before another word could be uttered, Og, who had been greatly alarmed at
      the preamble, arose with such suddenness, that Xit was precipitated to the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, your majesty," cried the giant, in great confusion, "it is
      true what the accursed imp says. I have the honour to be indirectly
      related to your highness. God's death, sirrah, I have half a mind to set
      my foot upon thee and crush thee. Thou art ever in mischief."
    </p>
    <p>
      The look and gesture, which accompanied this exclamation, were so
      indescribably like their royal parent, that neither the Queen nor the
      Princess Elizabeth could forbear laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Xit, the occurrence gained him a new friend in the person of Jane
      the Fool, who ran up as he was limping off with a crestfallen look, and
      begged her majesty's permission to take charge of him. This was granted,
      and the dwarf proceeded with the royal cortege. On learning the name of
      his protectress, Xit observed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wrongfully designated, sweetheart. Jane the Queen was Jane the
      Fool&mdash;you are Jane the Wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Mary had given some instructions in an under tone
      to Lord Clinton, and he immediately departed to fulfil them. The cavalcade
      next passed beneath the arch of the Bloody Tower, and the whole retinue
      drew up on the Green. A wide circle was formed round the queen, amid
      which, at intervals, might be seen the towering figures of the giants, and
      next to the elder of them, Xit, who having been obliged to quit his new
      friend had returned to Og and was standing on his tip-toes to obtain a
      peep at what was passing. No sooner had Mary taken up her position, than
      Lord Clinton re-appeared, and brought with him several illustrious persons
      who having suffered imprisonment in the fortress, for their zeal for the
      religion of Rome, wore now liberated by her command. As the first of the
      group, a venerable nobleman, Approached her and bent the knee before her,
      Mary's eyes filled with tears, and she exclaimed, in a voice of much
      emotion,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arise, my Lord Duke of Norfolk. The attainder pronounced against you in
      my father's reign is reversed. Your rank, your dignities, honours, and
      estates shall be restored to you."
    </p>

    <p>
      As the Duke retired, Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Grace shall not only have your bishoprick again," said Mary, "but
      you shall have another high and important office.&mdash;I here appoint you
      Lord Chancellor of the realm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness overwhelms me with kindness," replied Gardiner, pressing
      her hand to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no more than your desert, my lord," replied Mary. "But I pray
      you stand aside a moment. There are other claimants of our attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardiner withdrew, and another deprived bishop took his place. It was
      Bonner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said Mary, as he bowed before her, "you are restored to the see
      of London, and the prelate who now so unworthily fills that high post,
      Bishop Ridley, shall make room for you. My lord," she added to Lord
      Clinton, "make out a warrant, and let him be committed to the Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you how it would be," observed Renard to Lord Pembroke. "Ridley's
      last discourse has cost him his liberty. Cranmer will speedily follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Other prisoners, amongst whom was Tunstall, Bishop of Durham, and the
      Duchess of Somerset, now advanced, and were warmly welcomed by the Queen.
      The last person who approached her was a remarkably handsome young man,
      with fine features and a noble figure. This was Edward Courtenay, son of
      the Marquess of Exeter, who was beheaded in 1538. Since that time
      Courtenay had been a close prisoner in the Tower. He was of the
      blood-royal, being grandson of Catherine, youngest daughter of Edward the
      Fourth, and his father had been declared heir to the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right welcome, my cousin," said Mary, extending her hand
      graciously to him, which he pressed to his lips. "Your attainder shall be
      set aside, and though we cannot restore your father to life, we can repair
      the fortunes of his son, and restore him to his former honours.
      Henceforth, you are Earl of Devonshire. Your patent shall be presently
      made out, and such of your sire's possessions as are in our hands
      restored."
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay warmly thanked her for her bounty, and the Queen smiled upon him
      in such gracious sort, that a suspicion crossed more than one bosom that
      she might select him as her consort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her majesty smiles upon Courtenay as if she would bestow her hand upon
      him in right earnest," observed Pembroke to Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!" replied the ambassador. "This must be nipped in the bud. I have
      another husband in view for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your master, Philip of Spain, I'll be sworn," said Pembroke&mdash;"a
      suitable match, if he were not a Catholic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard made no answer, but he smiled an affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad this scheme has reached my ears," observed De Noailles, who
      overheard the conversation&mdash;"it will not suit my master, Henry II.,
      that England should form an alliance with Spain. I am for Courtenay, and
      will thwart Renard's plot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having received the whole of the prisoners, Mary gave orders to liberate
      all those within the Tower who might be confined for their adherence to
      the Catholic faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My first care," she said, "shall be to celebrate the obsequies of my
      brother, Edward VI.,&mdash;whose body, while others have been struggling
      for the throne, remains uninterred according to the forms of the Romish
      church. The service shall take place in Westminster Abbey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may not be, your highness," said Cranmer, who formed one of the
      group. "His late majesty was a Protestant prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beware how you oppose me, my lord," rejoined Mary, sternly. "I have
      already committed Ridley to prison, and shall not hesitate to commit your
      Grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness will act as it seems best to you," rejoined Cranmer,
      boldly; "but I shall fulfil my duty, even at the hazard of incurring your
      displeasure. Your royal brother professed the Protestant faith, which is,
      as yet,&mdash;though Heaven only knows how long it may continue so,&mdash;the
      established religion of this country, and he must, therefore, be interred
      according to the rites of that church. No other ceremonies, but those of
      the Protestant church, shall be performed within Westminster Abbey, as
      long as I maintain a shadow of power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," replied Mary. "We may find means to make your Grace more
      flexible. To-morrow, we shall publish a decree proclaiming our religious
      opinions. And it is our sovereign pleasure, that the words 'Papist' and
      'Heretic' be no longer used as terms of reproach."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have lived long enough," exclaimed the Duke of Norfolk, falling on his
      knees&mdash;"in living to see the religion of my fathers restored."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The providence which watched over your Grace's life, and saved you from
      the block, when your fate seemed all but sealed, reserved you for this
      day," rejoined Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It reserved me to be a faithful and devoted servant of your majesty,"
      replied the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your highness's pleasure touching the Duke of Northumberland,
      Lord Guilford Dudley, and Lady Jane Dudley?" inquired Clinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The two latter will remain closely confined till their arraignment,"
      replied Mary. "Lady Jane, also, will remain a prisoner for the present.
      And now, my lords, to the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, she turned her palfreys head, and passing under the Bloody
      Tower, proceeded to the principal entrance of the ancient structure, where
      she dismounted, and accompanied by a throng of nobles, dames, and
      attendants, entered the apartments so lately occupied by the unfortunate
      Jane.

      II.&mdash;HOW JANE WAS IMPRISONED IN THE BRICK TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he first shock
      over, Jane bore her reverse of fortune with the utmost patience and
      resignation, uttering no complaints, but making, in the language of
      Fuller, "misery itself amiable by her pious behaviour." She then reaped
      the full benefit of the religious education she had received, and her time
      was wholly passed in meditation, prayer, or profound study. Her demeanour
      was gentle and calm&mdash;graver and more thoughtful than it had been, but
      by no means cast down. If she had not regained her cheer-.fulness, she had
      fully recovered her composure; and the warder, Partridge, in whose
      habitation she was confined in the first instance, described her "as
      looking more like a queen than when she sat upon the throne."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, some days were spent, when word was brought her by an
      attendant, that a chamber had been prepared for her in the Brick Tower,
      and that a guard was without to conduct her to it. She received the
      intimation with composure, and immediately rose to obey it, requesting
      only that her books might be sent after her. The attendant, whose eyes
      were blinded with tears, promised to fulfil her wishes. On going forth,
      she found an officer and the three gigantic warders waiting to escort her
      to her prison. The party moved forward in silence, and at a slow pace.
      While crossing the Green, she perceived another group advancing towards
      her, and as it drew nearer, she found it was her husband attended by a
      guard. Uttering a loud cry, she would have rushed and thrown herself into
      his arms, if she had not been prevented by the officer. Dudley, whose eyes
      had been bent on the ground, heard the cry, and immediately knew by whom
      it was uttered. He made a movement similar to that of Jane, but like her
      he was checked by his attendants. So deeply, however, were the guards on
      either side moved by the anguish of the unfortunate pair, that, although
      expressly enjoined to the contrary, they suffered them to approach and
      embrace each other. The meeting drew tears from all eyes that beheld it;
      and the susceptible heart of Magog was so touched, that he had much ado to
      hide his grief. From the few hasty words she was able to exchange with her
      husband, Jane learnt that his prison had been changed, and that an order
      had been issued for his removal from the Beauchamp to the Bowyer Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every dungeon in the Tower," he said, "is filled with our friends and
      partisans. Your father, the Duke of Suffolk, is confined in the Martin
      Tower. And I have been just removed from the Beauchamp Tower to make room
      for my father, the Duke of Northumberland, my two brothers, Ambrose and
      Robert, and their faithful followers, Sir John Gates, Sir Henry Gates, and
      Sir Thomas Palmer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" cried Jane, "we are all equally culpable, and must all suffer
      alike. But we shall be speedily released."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the scaffold," rejoined Dudley, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, on the scaffold," repeated Jane. "And I trust though the remainder of
      our mortal life may be separated, that we shall meet above to part no
      more. Pray for this, my dear lord. It is my own constant prayer. And it is
      my firm reliance upon it that enables me to endure the agony of this
      meeting, which otherwise would kill me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will strive to do so, Jane," replied her husband. "But I still cling to
      life and hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Divest yourself of these vain desires, my Lord," cried Jane, earnestly,
      "and turn your thoughts from earth to heaven. There indeed we shall
      inherit an everlasting kingdom, undisturbed by misery and calamity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said the officer, advancing; "I grieve to abridge this short
      meeting. But my duty admits of no alternative. You must follow me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well, sir," she replied&mdash;"Farewell, dear Dudley. My prayers
      shall be for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mine for you, dear Jane," replied her husband, pressing her to his
      bosom&mdash;"Heaven grant me your patience and resignation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" she fervently ejaculated. And with another embrace, they parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a short distance the two escorts walked close together, during which
      the afflicted pair kept their eyes fondly fixed on each other. After
      passing the north-west corner of the White Tower, Lord Guilford's
      attendants took a straight-forward course, while Jane's guards proceeded
      to the right. Still but a short distance intervened between them, until
      Jane beheld her husband disappear beneath the low-arched entrance of the
      Bowyer Tower. A convulsive movement passed over her frame; but the next
      moment she was apparently as calm as ever, and followed the officer into
      the structure destined for her reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, as has already been intimated, was the Brick Tower, the next turret
      on the east of the Bowyer Tower. The upper story, which is of brick&mdash;whence
      its name&mdash;was erected in the reign of Edward the Fourth, or Richard
      the Third: the basement story is of stone, and of much greater antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering a narrow passage, she was ushered by the officer into a small
      room, which he informed her was prepared for her reception. Everything
      that circumstances would admit appeared to have been done to lessen the
      rigour of her confinement. The stone walls were hung with arras; and much
      of the furniture a carved oak table, and velvet-covered scats, placed in
      the deep embrasures of the windows&mdash;had been brought from Jane's late
      chamber in the palace.

      "This seat, said the officer, pointing to a curiously-carved chair, * was
      used by Queen Anne Boleyn during her imprisonment. I had it brought hither
      for your ladyship's accommodation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for your consideration, sir," replied Jane; "it will serve to
      support one as unhappy as that ill-fated princess." Having inquired
      whether she had any further commands with which it was possible for him to
      comply, and being answered in the negative, the officer took his
      departure, and Jane was left alone.

      Alone! the thought struck chill to her heart. She was now a solitary
      captive. She heard the door of her prison bolted&mdash;she examined its
      stone walls, partly concealed by the tapestry&mdash;she glanced at its
      iron-barred windows, and her courage forsook her. She had no bosom to lean
      upon&mdash;no ear to which she could impart her sorrows. Her husband,
      though not far from her, was, like her a prisoner. She pictured him in his
      solitary room&mdash;and she would have given worlds to be near him&mdash;if
      only for a few moments. The thought occasioned her so much anguish, that
      she burst into tears, and for some time was a prey to despair. She then
      knelt down beside the chair, and burying her face in her clasped hands,
      prayed deeply and fervently for support through her trial. And she prayed
      not in vain. She soon afterwards arose tranquil and refreshed.

    <h2>
      III.-HOW SIMON RENARD ASCENDED TO THE ROOF OF THE WHITE TOWER; AND OF THE
      GOODLY PROSPECT HE BEHELD THEREFROM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he night of Queen
      Mary's entrance into the Tower was spent by Simon Renard, the Duke of
      Norfolk, Gardiner (the new Lord Chancellor), Courtenay, Arundel, Pembroke,
      and other noble and honourable persons composing her council, in framing a
      public declaration of her religious opinions, to be proclaimed on the
      morrow, and in deliberating on other mighty matters connected with the
      establishment of her government. Throughout this consultation, when any
      difference of opinion arose, the matter was invariably deferred to the
      judgment of the imperial ambassador, whose decision was regarded as final;
      and as he was looked upon as the chief instrument in crushing the late
      rebellion, so it was supposed he could, by his sagacity and influence,
      establish Mary upon her throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when the council separated, and instead of returning to his
      apartments in the palace, Renard, fevered and wearied by the protracted
      discussion at which he had assisted, preferred refreshing himself by a
      stroll in the open air. Accordingly, he proceeded to the green, and began
      to pace backwards and forwards, at a brisk pace, between the lieutenant's
      lodgings and the chapel. He continued this exercise for nearly an hour,
      pondering upon recent events, and revolving future schemes within his
      plotting brain, when just as day was breaking, and the hoary walls of the
      White Tower began to reveal themselves in all their grandeur, he perceived
      a man, armed with a caliver, advancing to meet him. Renard stood still,
      and throwing his ample cloak over his shoulder, awaited the new comers
      approach. It proved to be a warder, who, having seen him as he was going
      his rounds, at first supposed he had some ill designs in view, but finding
      out his mistake, as he drew nearer and recognised the Spanish ambassador,
      with whose person he was familiar, he was about to withdraw, when Renard
      called him back and demanded his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am called Gervase Winwike, worshipful sir," readied the man, "and am
      one of the senior warders of the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither are you going, friend?" inquired Renard. "To the summit of the
      White Tower," answered Winwike; "to see that the sentinels are at their
      posts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it inconsistent with your duty to take me with you?" asked the
      ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means," rejoined the warder. "I shall feel honoured by your
      presence. We shall reach the roof just at sunrise, and the view from
      thence, on a fine clear morning like the present, is magnificent beyond
      compare, and will amply repay your worship for climbing up so many steps
      as you will have to scale to obtain it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us make what haste we can, then," said Renard, "I am impatient to
      behold it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, Winwike led the way to the north-west turret of the ancient
      structure, before a door in which a sentinel was stationed, who, on
      receiving the pass-word, lowered his halbert, and suffered them to enter.
      They were now within a small circular chamber, from which a flight of
      spiral stone steps ascended. Followed by Renard, the warder commenced the
      ascent. Light was admitted at intervals through loop-holes, gradually
      diminishing in width as they approached the exterior of the walls, and
      serving to reveal their immense thickness. As they mounted, Winwike
      pointed out to his companion the entrance of a passage communicating with
      the Council-chamber. Renard was much struck with the substantial and
      beautiful masonry of the turret; but being anxious to gain the roof as
      soon as possible, he urged his companion to quicken his pace, and they
      soon arrived at an arched door, which Winwike threw open, and they stepped
      upon the roof..
    </p>
    <p>
      Springing upon the platform, Renard was about to rush to the battlements,
      when Winwike offered to lead him to the best point of view. As he followed
      his conductor towards the southwest angle, Renard cast his eye over the
      roof. Cannon were placed on the raised platform, while armed men were
      stationed at twenty paces distant from each other. In the centre of the
      building stood a tall staff, from which floated the royal banner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depositing his caliver against the wall of the turret, Winwike told his
      companion to look around. Renard obeyed, and a glorious panorama met his
      gaze. Immediately beneath him lay the fortress, with its chain of flowers&mdash;its
      ramparts&mdash;its fortifications&mdash;its bridges, and its broad deep
      moat. Beyond was spread out old and picturesque London, with its numerous
      steeples, above which rose the massive tower of St. Paul's. A little on
      the left was old London Bridge, covered with out-houses&mdash;the noise of
      the falling water, and the mills, being distinctly audible where they
      stood. Nearer, was the river glittering in the sunbeams, and filled with a
      forest of masts. Renard contemplated this prospect for some time in silent
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you behold the Tower of London," said Winwike, pointing downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there I read the history of England," replied Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is written in those towers it is a dark and bloody history,"
      replied the warder&mdash;"and yet your worship says truly. The building on
      which we stand, and those around us, are the best chronicles of our
      country. I can recount to your worship their foundation, and the chief
      events that have happened within them, if you are disposed to listen to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed then," replied Renard, "and when I have had enough I will
      interrupt you."

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n 1078, (for,
      instead of following the warder's narrative to Simon Renard, it appears
      advisable in this place to offer a slight sketch of the renowned fortress,
      under consideration, especially as such a course will allow of its history
      being brought down to a later period than could otherwise be
      accomplished,) the Tower of London was founded by William the Conqueror,
      who appointed Gundulph, Bishop of Exeter, principal overseer of the work.
      By this prelate, who seems to have been a good specimen of the church
      militant, and who, during the progress of his operations, was lodged in
      the house, of Edmere, a burgess of London, a part of the city wall,
      adjoining the northern banks of the Thames, which had been much injured by
      the incursions of the tide, was taken down, and a "great square tower,"
      since called the White Tower, erected on its site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some writers have assigned an earlier date to this edifice, ascribing its
      origin to the great Roman invader of our shores, whence it has been
      sometimes denominated Cæsar's Tower; and the hypothesis is supposed to be
      confirmed by Fitz Stephens, a monkish historian of the period of Henry the
      Second, who states, that "the city of London hath in the east a very great
      and most strong Palatine Tower, whose turrets and walls do rise from a
      deep foundation, the mortar thereof being tempered with the blood of
      beasts." On this authority, Dr. Stukeley has introduced a fort, which he
      terms the <i>Arx Palatina</i>, in his plan of Londinium Augusta. But,
      though it is not improbable that some Roman military station may have
      stood on the spot now occupied by the White Tower,&mdash;certain coins and
      other antiquities having been found by the workmen in sinking the
      foundations of the Ordnance Office in 1777,&mdash;it is certain that no
      part of the present structure was erected by Julius Cæsar; nor can he,
      with propriety, be termed the founder of the Tower of London. As to its
      designation, that amounts to little, since, as has been shrewdly remarked
      by M. Dulaure, in his description of the Grand Châtelet at Paris&mdash;"every
      old building, the origin of which is buried in obscurity, is attributed to
      Cæsar or the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourteen years afterwards, in the reign of William Rufus, who, according
      to Henry of Huntingdon, "pilled and shaved the people with tribute,
      especially about the Tower of London," the White Tower was greatly damaged
      by a violent storm, which, among other ravages, carried off the roof of
      Bow Church, and levelled above six hundred habitations with the ground. It
      was subsequently repaired, and an additional tower built on the south side
      near the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strengthened by Geoffrey de Magnaville, Earl of Essex, and fourth
      constable of the fortress, who defended it against the usurper Stephen,
      but was, nevertheless, eventually compelled to surrender it; repaired in
      1155, by Thomas à Becket, then Chancellor to Henry the Second; greatly
      extended and enlarged in 1190, the second year of the reign of Richard
      Cour de Lion, by William Longchamp, Bishop of Ely and Chancellor of the
      realm, who, encroaching to some distance upon Tower Hill, and breaking
      down the city wall as far as the first gate called the postern, surrounded
      it with high embattled walls of stone, and a broad deep ditch, thinking,
      as Stowe observes, "to have environed it with the river Thames;"&mdash;the
      Tower of London was finished by Henry the Third, who, in spite of the
      remonstrances of the citizens, and other supernatural warnings, if credit
      is to be attached to the statement of Matthew of Paris, completely
      fortified it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gate and bulwark having been erected on the west of the Tower, we are
      told by the old chronicler above-mentioned, "that they were shaken as it
      had been with an earthquake and fell down, which the king again commanded
      to be built in better sort, which was done. And yet, again, in the year
      1241, the said wall and bulwarks that were newly builded, whereon the king
      had bestowed more than twelve thousand marks, were irrecoverably quite
      thrown down as before; for the which chance the citizens of London were
      nothing sorry, for they were threatened, that the said wall and bulwarks
      were builded, to the end, that if any of them would contend for the
      liberties of the city, they might be imprisoned. And that many might be
      laid in divers prisons, many lodgings were made, that no one should speak
      with another." These remarkable accidents (if accidents they were,) were
      attributed by the popular superstition of the times, to the miraculous
      interference of Thomas à Becket, the guardian saint of the Londoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the same monarch the storehouse was strengthened and repaired, and the
      keep or citadel whitened, (whence probably it derived its name, as it was
      afterwards styled in Edward the Third's reign "<i>La Blanche Tour</i>") as
      appears by the following order still preserved in the Tower Rolls:&mdash;"We
      command you to repair the garner within the said tower, and well amend it
      throughout, wherever needed. And also concerning all the leaden gutters of
      the Great Tower, from the top of the said tower, through which the rain
      water must fall down, to lengthen them, and make them come down even to
      the ground; so that the wall of the said tower, lately whitened anew, may
      by no means decay, nor easily break out, by reason of the rain water
      dropping down. But to make upon the said towers <i>alures</i> of good and
      strong timber, and throughout to be well leaded; by which people might see
      even to the foot of the said tower, and better to go up and down, if need
      be." Further orders were given in this reign for the beautifying and
      fitting up the chapels of Saint John and Saint Peter, as already mentioned
      in the account of those structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same monarch planted a grove, or orchard of "perie trees," as they are
      described in his mandate to Edward of Westminster, in the vicinity of the
      Tower, and surrounded it with a wall of mud, afterwards replaced by
      another of brick, in the reign of Edward the Fourth. He likewise
      established a menagerie within the fortress, allotting a part of the
      bulwark at the western entrance since called the Lions' Tower, for the
      reception of certain wild beasts, and as a lodging for their keeper. In
      1235, the Emperor Frederick sent him three leopards, in allusion to his
      scutcheon, on which three of those animals were emblazoned; and from that
      time, down to a very recent date, a menagerie has been constantly
      maintained within the Tower. To support it, Edward the Second commanded
      the Sheriffs of London to pay the keeper of his lions sixpence a day for
      their food, and three half-pence a-day for the man's own diet, out of the
      fee farm of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Constant alterations and reparations wero made to the ramparts and towers
      during subsequent reigns. Edward the Fourth encroached still further on
      Tower Hill than his predecessors, and erected an outer gate called the
      Bulwark Tower. In the fifth year of the reign of this monarch, a scaffold
      and gallows having been erected on Tower Hill, the citizens, ever jealous
      of their privileges and liberties, complained of the step; and to appease
      them, a proclamation was made to the effect, "that the erection, and
      setting up of the said gallows be not a precedent or example thereby
      hereafter to be taken, in hurt, prejudice, or derogation, of the
      franchises, liberties, and privileges of the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard the Third repaired the Tower, and Stow records a commission to
      Thomas Daniel, directing him to seize for use within this realm, as many
      masons, bricklayers, and other workmen, as should be thought necessary for
      the expedition of the king's works within the Tower. In the twenty-third
      of Henry the Eighth, the whole of the fortress appears to have undergone
      repair&mdash;a survey being taken of its different buildings, which is is
      still preserved in the Chapter-house at Westminster. In the second of
      Edward the Sixth, the following strange accident occurred, by which one of
      the fortifications was destroyed. A Frenchman, lodged in the Middle Tower,
      accidentally set fire to a barrel of gunpowder, which blew up the
      structure, fortunately without damage to any other than the luckless
      causer of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the period of this chronicle, as at the present time, the Tower of
      London comprehended within its walls a superficies of rather more than
      twelve acres, and without the moat a circumference of three thousand feet
      and upwards. Consisting of a citadel or keep, surrounded by an inner and
      outer ward, it was approached on the west by an entrance called the
      Bulwark Gate, which has long since disappeared. The second entrance was
      formed by an embattled tower, called the Lion's Gate, conducting to a
      strong tower flanked with bastions, and defended by a double portcullis,
      denominated the Middle Tower. The outworks adjoining these towers, in
      which was kept the menagerie, were surrounded by a smaller moat,
      communicating with the main ditch. A large drawbridge then led to another
      portal, in all respects resembling that last described, forming the
      principal entrance to the outer ward, and called the By-ward or Gate
      Tower. The outer ward was defended by a strong line of fortifications; and
      at the north-east corner stood a large circular bastion, called the Mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inner ward or ballium was defended by thirteen towers, connected by an
      embattled stone wall about forty feet, high and twelve feet thick, on the
      summit of which was a footway for the guard. Of these towers, three were
      situated at the west, namely, the Bell, the Beauchamp and the Devilin
      Towers; four at the north, the Flint, the Bowyer, the Brick, and the
      Martin Towers; three at the east, the Constable, the Broad Arrow, and Salt
      Towers; and three on the south, the Well, the Lanthorn, and the Bloody
      Tower. The Flint Tower has almost disappeared; the Bowyer Tower only
      retains its basement story; and the Brick Tower has been so much
      modernized as to retain little of its pristine character. The Martin Tower
      is now denominated the Jewel Tower, from the circumstance of its being the
      depositary of the regalia. The Lanthorn Tower has been swept away with the
      old palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the outer ward, the principal fortification on the south was
      a large square structure, flanked at each angle by an embattled tower.
      This building, denominated Saint Thomas's, or Traitor's Tower, was erected
      across the moat, and masked a secret entrance from the Thames, through
      which state prisoners, as has before been related, were brought into the
      Tower. It still retains much of its original appearance, and recals
      forcibly to the mind of the observer the dismal scenes that have occurred
      beneath its low-browed arches. Further on the east, in a line with
      Traitor's Tower, and terminating a wing of the old palace, stood the
      Cradle Tower. At the eastern angle of the outer ward was a small
      fortification over-looking the moat, known as the Tower leading to the
      Iron Gate. Beyond it a draw-bridge crossed the moat, and led to the Iron
      Gate, a small portal protected by a tower, deriving its name from the
      purpose for which it was erected.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, on the patch of ground intervening between the moat and the
      river, and forming the platform or wharf, stood a range of mean
      habitations, occupied by the different artisans and workmen employed in
      the fortress. At the south of the By-ward Tower, an arched and embattled
      gateway opened upon a drawbridge which crossed the moat at this point.
      Opposite this drawbridge were the main stairs leading to the edge of the
      river. The whole of the fortress, it is scarcely necessary to repeat, was
      (and still is) encompassed by a broad deep moat, of much greater width at
      the sides next to Tower Hill and East Smithfield, than at the south, and
      supplied with water from the Thames by the sluice beneath Traitor's Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now made a general circuit of the fortress, we shall return to the
      inner ballium, which is approached on the south by a noble gateway,
      erected in the reign of Edward the Third. A fine specimen of the
      architecture of the fourteenth century, this portal is vaulted with
      groined arches adorned with exquisite tracery springing from grotesque
      heads. At the period of this chronicle, it was defended at each end by a
      massive gate clamped with iron, and a strong portcullis. The gate and
      portcullis at the southern extremity still exist, but those at the north
      have been removed. The structure above it was anciently called the Garden
      Tower; but subsequently acquired the appellation of the Bloody Tower, from
      having been the supposed scene of the murder of the youthful princes, sons
      of Edward the Fourth, by the ruthless Duke of Gloucester, afterwards
      Richard the Third. Without pausing to debate the truth of this tragical
      occurrence, it may be sufficient to mention that tradition assigns it to
      this building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding along the ascent leading towards the green, and mounting a
      flight of stone steps on the left, we arrive in front of the ancient
      lodgings allotted to the lieutenant of the Tower. Chiefly constructed of
      timber, and erected at the beginning of the sixteenth century, this fabric
      has been so much altered, that it retains little of its original
      character. In one of the rooms, called, from the circumstance, the
      Council-chamber, the conspirators concerned in the Gunpowder Plot were
      interrogated; and in memory of the event, a piece of sculpture, inscribed
      with their names, and with those of the commissioners by whom they were
      examined, has been placed against the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately behind the lieutenant's lodgings stands the Bell Tower,&mdash;a
      circular structure, surmounted by a small wooden turret containing the
      alarm-bell of the fortress. Its walls are of great thickness, and light is
      admitted through narrow loopholes. On the basement floor is a small
      chamber, with deeply-recessed windows, and a vaulted roof of very curious
      construction. This tower served as a place of imprisonment to John Fisher,
      the martyred bishop of Rochester, beheaded on Tower Hill for denying Henry
      the Eighth's supremacy; and to the Princess Elizabeth, who was confined
      within it by her sister, Queen Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traversing the green, some hundred and forty feet brings us to the
      Beauchamp, or Cobham Tower, connected with the Bell Tower by means of a
      footway on the top of the ballium wall. Erected in the reign of Henry the
      Third, as were most of the smaller towers of the fortress, this structure
      appears, from the numerous inscriptions, coats of arms, and devices that
      crowd its walls, to have been the principal state-prison. Every room, from
      roof to vault, is covered with melancholy memorials of its illustrious and
      unfortunate occupants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the fire-place in the principal chamber, (now used as a mess-room by
      the officers of the garrison,) is the autograph of Philip Howard, Earl of
      Arundel, beheaded in 1572, for aspiring to the hand of Mary Queen of
      Scots. On the right of the fire-place, at the entrance of a recess, are
      these words:&mdash;"Dolor Patientia vincitur. G. Gyfford. August 8, 1586."
      Amongst others, for we can only give a few as a specimen of the rest, is
      the following enigmatical inscription. It is preceded by the date 1568,
      April 28, but is unaccompanied by any signature.

    <p>
      Of this unfortunate person the following interesting account is given by
      Mr. Jardine, in his valuable treatise on the <i>Use of Torture in the
      Criminal Law of England.</i> "Thomas Myagh was an Irishman who was brought
      over by the command of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, to be examined
      respecting a treasonable correspondence with the rebels in arms in that
      country. The first warrant for the torture of this man was probably under
      the sign-manual, as there is no entry of it in the council register. The
      two reports made by the Lieutenant of the Tower and Dr. Hammond,
      respecting their execution of this warrant, are, however, to be seen at
      the State-Paper Office. The first of these, which is dated the 10th of
      March, 1580-1, states that they had twice examined Myagh, but had forborne
      to put him in Skevington's Irons, because they had been charged to examine
      him with secrecy, 'which they could not do, that manner of dealing
      requiring the presence and aid of one of the jailors all the time that he
      should be in those irons,' and also because they 'found the man so
      resolute, as in their opinions little would be wrung out of him but by
      some sharper torture.' The second report, which is dated the 17th of
      March, 1580, merely states that they had again examined Myagh, and could
      get nothing from him, 'notwithstanding that they had made trial of him by
      the torture of Skevington's irons, and with so much sharpness, as was in
      their judgment for the man and his cause convenient.' How often Myagh was
      tortured does not appear; but Skevington's irons seem to have been too
      mild a torture, for on the 30th of July, 1581, there is an entry in the
      council books of an authority to the Lieutenant of the Tower and Thomas
      Norton, to deal with him with the rack in such sort as they should see
      cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      From many sentences expressive of the resignation of the sufferers, we
      take the following, subscribed A. Poole, 1564:&mdash;"Deo. servire.
      penitentiam. inire. fato. ohedire. regnare. est." Several inscriptions are
      left by this person&mdash;one four years later than the foregoing, is as
      follows: "<i>A passage perillus maketh a port pleasant</i>." Here is
      another sad memento: "<i>O miser Hyon, che pensi od essero.</i>" Another:
      "<i>Reprens le: sage: et: il: te: aimera: J. S. 1538</i>." A third: "<i>Principium
      sapientio timor Domini, I. h. s. x. p. s. Be friend to one. Be ennemye to
      none. Anno D. 1571, 10 Sept. The most unhappy man in the world is he that
      is not patient in adversities: For men are not killed with the adversities
      they have, but with the impatience they suffer. Tout vient apoint, quy
      peult attendre. Gli sospiri ne son testimoni veri dell angoscia mia. Æt.
      20. Charles Bailly.</i>".
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of these records breathe resignation. But the individual who carved
      the following record, and whose naine has passed away, appears to have
      numbered every moment of his captivity: "<i>Close prisoner 8 months, 32
      wekees, 224 dayes, 5376 houres</i>." How much of anguish is comprised in
      this brief sentence!
    </p>
    <p>
      We could swell out this list, if necessary, to a volume, but the above may
      suffice to show their general character. Let those who would know how much
      their forefathers have endured cast their eyes over the inscriptions in
      the Beauchamp Tower. In general they are beautifully carved, ample time
      being allowed the writers for their melancholy employment. It has been
      asserted that Anne Boleyn was confined in the uppermost room of the
      Beauchamp Tower. But if an inscription may be trusted, she was imprisoned
      in the Martin Tower (now the Jewel Tower) at that time a prison lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Postponing the description of the remaining towers until we have occasion
      to speak of them in detail, we shall merely note, in passing, the two
      strong towers situated at the southwestern extremity of the White Tower,
      called the Coal Harbour Gate, over which there was a prison denominated
      the Nun's Bower, and proceed to the palace, of which, unluckily for the
      lovers of antiquity, not a vestige now remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erected at different periods, and consisting of a vast range of halls,
      galleries, courts and gardens, the old palace occupied, in part, the site
      of the modern Ordnance Office. Commencing at the Coal Harbour Gate, it
      extended in a south-easterly direction to the Lanthorn Tower, and from
      thence branched off in a magnificent pile of building, called the Queen's
      Gallery, to the Salt Tower. In front of this gallery, defended by the
      Cradle Tower and the Well Tower, was the privy garden. Behind it stretched
      a large quadrangular area, terminated at the western angle by the Wardrobe
      Tower, and at the eastern angle by the Broad Arrow Tower. It was enclosed
      on the left by a further range of buildings, termed the Queen's Lodgings,
      and on the right by the inner ballium wall. The last-mentioned buildings
      were also connected with the White Tower, and with a small embattled
      structure flanked by a circular tower, denominated the Jewel House where
      the regalia were then kept. In front of the Jewel House stood a large
      decayed hall, forming part of the palace; opposite which was a court,
      planted with trees, and protected by the ballium wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ancient palace&mdash;the scene of so many remarkable historical
      events,&mdash;the residence, during certain portions of their reigns, of
      all our sovereigns, from William Rufus down to Charles the Second&mdash;is
      now utterly gone. Where is the glorious hall which Henry the Third painted
      with the story of Antiochus, and which it required thirty fir-trees to
      repair,&mdash;in which Edward the Third and all his court were feasted by
      the captive John,&mdash;in which Richard the Second resigned his crown to
      Henry of Lancaster,&mdash;in which Henry the Eighth received all his wives
      before their espousals,&mdash;in which so many royal councils and royal
      revels have been held;&mdash;where is that great hall? Where, also, is the
      chamber in which Queen Isabella, consort of Edward the Second, gave birth
      to the child called, from the circumstance, Joan of the Tower? They have
      vanished, and other structures occupy their place. Demolished in the reign
      of James the Second, an ordnance office was erected on its site; and this
      building being destroyed by fire in 1788, it was succeeded by the present
      edifice bearing the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having now surveyed the south of the fortress, we shall return to the
      north. Immediately behind Saint Peter's Chapel stood the habitations of
      the officers of the then ordnance department, and next to them an
      extensive range of storehouses, armouries, granaries, and other magazines,
      reaching to the Martin Tower. On the site of these buildings was erected,
      in the reign of William the Third, that frightful structure, which we
      trust the better taste of this, or some future age will remove&mdash;the
      Grand Storehouse. Nothing can be imagined more monstrous or incongruous
      than this ugly Dutch toy, (for it is little better,) placed side by side
      with a stern old Norman donjon, fraught with a thousand historical
      associations and recollections. It is the great blot upon the Tower. And
      much as the destruction of the old palace is to be lamented, the erection
      of such a building as this, in such a place, is infinitely more to be
      deplored. We trust to see it rased to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the Constable Tower stood another range of buildings
      appropriated to the different officers and workmen connected with the
      Mint, which, until the removal of the place of coinage to its present
      situation on Little Tower Hill, it is almost needless to say, was held
      within the walls of the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White Tower once more claims our attention. Already described as
      having walls of enormous thickness, this venerable stronghold is divided
      into four stories including the vaults. The latter consist of two large
      chambers and a smaller one, with a coved termination at the east, and a
      deeply-recessed arch at the opposite extremity. Light is admitted to this
      gloomy chamber by four semicircular-headed loopholes. At the north is a
      cell ten feet long by eight wide formed in the thickness of the wall, and
      receiving no light except from the doorway. Here tradition affirms that
      Sir Walter Raleigh was confined, and composed his History of the World.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other half-obliterated inscriptions carved on the arched doorway
      of this dungeon, are these: <i>He that indvreth TO THE ENDE SHALL BE
      SAVID. M. 10. R. REDSTON. DAR. KENT. Ano. 1553.&mdash;Be feithful to the
      death and I will give the a crown of life. T. Fane. 1554.</i> Above stands
      Saint John's Chapel, and the upper story is occupied by the
      council-chamber and the rooms adjoining. A narrow vaulted gallery, formed
      in the thickness of the wall, communicating with the turret stairs, and
      pierced with semicircular-headed openings for the admission of light to
      the interior, surrounds this story. The roof is covered with lead, and
      crowned with four lofty turrets, three angular and one square, surmounted
      with leaden cupolas, each terminated with a vane and crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have spoken elsewhere, and shall have to speak again of the secret and
      subterranean passages, as well as of the dungeons of the Tower; those
      horrible and noisome receptacles, deprived of light and air, infested by
      legions of rats, and flooded with water, into which the wretched captives
      were thrust to perish by famine, or by more expeditious means; and those
      dreadful contrivances, the Little Ease&mdash;and the Pit;&mdash;the latter
      a dark and gloomy excavation sunk to the depth of twenty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the foregoing hasty sketch, in which we have endeavoured to make the
      reader acquainted with the general outline of the fortress, we would
      willingly, did space permit, append a history of the principal occurrences
      that have happened within its walls. We would tell how in 1234, Griffith,
      Prince of Wales, in attempting to escape from the White Tower, by a line
      made of hangings, sheets, and table-cloths, tied together, being a stout
      heavy man, broke the rope, and falling from a great height, perished
      miserably&mdash;his head and neck being driven into his breast between the
      shoulders. How Edward the Third first established a Mint within the Tower,
      coining florences of gold. How in the reign of the same monarch, three
      sovereigns were prisoners there;&mdash;namely, John, King of France, his
      son Philip, and David, King of Scotland. How in the fourth year of the
      reign of Richard the Second, during the rebellion of Wat Tyler, the
      insurgents having possessed themselves of the fortress, though it was
      guarded by six hundred valiant persons, expert in arms, and the like
      number of archers, conducted themselves with extraordinary licence,
      bursting into the king's chamber, and that of his mother, to both of whom
      they offered divers outrages and indignities; and finally dragged forth
      Simon Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, and hurrying him to Tower Hill,
      hewed off his head at eight strokes, and fixed it on a pole on London
      Bridge, where it was shortly afterwards replaced by that of Wat Tyler.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, in 1458, jousts were held on the Tower-Green by the Duke of Somerset
      and five others, before Queen Margaret of Anjou. How in 1471, Henry the
      Sixth, at that time a prisoner, was said to be murdered within the Tower;
      how seven years later, George Duke of Clarence, was drowned in a butt of
      Malmsey in the Bowyer Tower; and how five years after that, the youthful
      Edward the Fifth, and the infant Duke of York, were also <i>said</i>, for
      the tradition is more than doubtful, to be smothered in the Blood Tower.
      How in 1483, by command of the Duke of Gloucester, who had sworn he would
      not dine till he had seen his head off, Lord Hastings was brought forth to
      the green before the chapel, and after a short shrift, "for a longer could
      not be suffered, the protector made so much haste to dinner, which he
      might not go to until this were done, for saving of his oath," his head
      was laid down upon a large log of timber, and stricken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      How in 1512, the woodwork and decorations of Saint John's chapel in the
      White Tower were burnt. How in the reign of Henry the Eighth, the prisons
      were constantly filled, and the scaffold deluged with blood. How Sir
      Richard Empson and Edmund Dudley, the hither of John Dudley, Duke of
      Northumberland, were beheaded. How the like fate attended the Duke of
      Buckingham, destroyed by Wolsey, the martyred John Fisher, Bishop of
      Rochester, the wise and witty Sir Thomas More, Anne Boleyn, her brother
      Lord Rochford, Norris, Smeaton, and others; the Marquis of Exeter, Lord
      Montacute, and Sir Edward Neville; Thomas, Lord Cromwell, the counsellor
      of the dissolution of the monasteries; the venerable and courageous
      Countess of Salisbury; Lord Leonard Grey; Katherine Howard and Lady
      Rochford; and Henry, Earl of Surrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, in the reign of Edward the Sixth, his two uncles, Thomas Seymour,
      Baron Sudley, and Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, were brought to the
      block; the latter, as has been before related, by the machinations of
      Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing over, for obvious reasons, the reign of Mary, and proceeding to
      that of Elizabeth, we might relate how Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, was
      beheaded; how the dungeons were crowded with recusants and seminary
      priests; amongst others, by the famous Jesuits, fathers Campion and
      Persons; how Lord Stourton, whose case seems to have resembled the more
      recent one of Lord Ferrers, was executed for the murder of the Hartgills;
      how Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, shot himself in his chamber,
      declaring that the jade Elizabeth should not have his estate; and how the
      long catalogue was closed by the death of the Earl of Essex.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, in the reign of James the First, Sir Walter Raleigh was beheaded, and
      Sir Thomas Overbury poisoned. How in that of Charles the First, Thomas
      Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, and Archbishop Laud, underwent a similar
      fate. How in 1656, Miles Sunderland, having been condemned for high
      treason, poisoned himself; notwithstanding which, his body, stripped of
      all apparel, was dragged at the horse's tail to Tower Hill, where a hole
      had been digged under the scaffold, into which it was thrust, and a stake
      driven through it. How, in 1661, Lord Monson and Sir Henry Mildmay
      suffered, and in the year following Sir Henry Vane. How in the same reign
      Blood attempted to steal the crown; and how Algernon Percy and Lord
      William Russell were executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      How, under James the Second, the rash and unfortunate Duke of Monmouth
      perished. How, after the rebellion of 1715, Lords Derwentwater and Kenmuro
      were decapitated; and after that of 1745, Lords Kilmarnock, Bahnerino, and
      Lovat. How in 1760, Lord Ferrers was committed to the Tower for the murder
      of his steward, and expiated his offence at Tyburn. How Wilkes was
      imprisoned there for a libel in 1762; and Lord George Gordon for
      instigating the riots of 1780. How, to come to our own times, Sir Francis
      Burdett was conveyed thither in April 1810; and how, to close the list,
      the Cato-street conspirators, Thistlewood, Ings, and others, were confined
      there in 1820.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief officer appointed to the custody of the royal fortress, is
      termed the Constable of the Tower;&mdash;a place, in the words of Stowe,
      of "high honour and reputation, as well as of great trust, many earls and
      one duke having been constable of the Tower." Without enumerating all
      those who have filled this important post, it maybe sufficient to state,
      that the first constable was Geoffrey de Mandeville, appointed by William
      the Conqueror; the last, Arthur, Duke of Wellington. Next in command is
      the lieutenant, after whom come the deputy-lieutenant, and major, or
      resident governor. The civil establishment consists of a chaplain,
      gentleman-porter, physician, surgeon, and apothecary; gentleman-jailer,
      yeoman porter, and forty yeomen warders. In addition to these, though in
      no way connected with the government or custody of the Tower, there are
      the various officers belonging to the ordnance department; the keepers of
      the records, the keeper of the regalia; and formerly there were the
      different officers of the Mint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lions of the Tower&mdash;once its chief attraction with the many,&mdash;have
      disappeared. Since the establishment of the Zoological Gardens, curiosity
      having been drawn in that direction, the dens of the old menagerie are
      deserted, and the sullen echoes of the fortress are no longer awakened by
      savage yells and howling. With another and more important attraction&mdash;the
      armories&mdash;it is not our province to meddle.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To return to Simon Renard and the warder. Having concluded his recital, to
      which the other listened with profound attention, seldom interrupting him
      with a remark, Winwike proposed, if his companion's curiosity was
      satisfied, to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have given me food for much reflection." observed Renard, aroused
      from a reverie into which he had fallen; "but before we return I would
      gladly walk round the buildings. I had no distinct idea of the Tower till
      I came hither."
    </p>
    <p>
      The warder complied, and led the way round the battlements, pausing
      occasionally to point out some object of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed from the summit of the White Tower, especially on the west, the
      fortress still offers a striking picture. In the middle of the sixteenth
      century, when its outer ramparts were strongly fortified&mdash;when the
      gleam of corslet and pike was reflected upon the dark waters of its moat&mdash;when
      the inner ballium walls were entire and unbroken, and its thirteen towers
      reared their embattled fronts&mdash;when within each of those towers state
      prisoners were immured&mdash;when its drawbridges were constantly raised,
      and its gates closed&mdash;when its palace still lodged a sovereign&mdash;when
      councils were held within its chambers&mdash;when its secret dungeons were
      crowded&mdash;when Tower Hill boasted a scaffold, and its soil was dyed
      with the richest and best blood of the land&mdash;when it numbered among
      its inferior officers, jailors, torturers, and an executioner&mdash;when
      all its terrible machinery was in readiness, and could be called into play
      at a moment's notice&mdash;when the steps of Traitor's Gate wore worn by
      the feet of those who ascended, them&mdash;when, on whichever side the
      gazer looked, the same stern prospect was presented&mdash;the palace, the
      fortress, the prison,&mdash;a triple conjunction of fearful significance&mdash;when
      each structure had dark secrets to conceal&mdash;when beneath all these
      ramparts, towers, and bulwarks, were subterranean passages and dungeons&mdash;<i>then</i>,
      indeed, it presented a striking picture both to the eye and mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly following his companion, Renard counted all the towers, which,
      including that whereon he was standing, and these connected with the
      bulwarks and palace, amounted to twenty-two,&mdash;marked their position&mdash;commented
      upon the palace, and the arrangement of its offices and outbuildings&mdash;examined
      its courts and gardens&mdash;inquired into the situation of the queen's
      apartments, and was shown a long line of buildings with a pointed roof,
      extending from the south-east angle of the keep to the Lanthorn Tower&mdash;admired
      the magnificent prospect of the heights of Surrey and Kent&mdash;traced
      the broad stream of the Thames as far as Greenwich&mdash;suffered his gaze
      to wander over the marshy tract of country towards Essex&mdash;noted the
      postern gate in the ancient city walls, standing at the edge of the north
      bank of the moat&mdash;traced those walls by their lofty entrances from
      Aldgate to Cripplegate, and from thence returned to the church of All
      Hallows Barking, and Tower Hill. The last object upon which his gaze
      rested was the scaffold. A sinister smile played upon his features as he
      gazed on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," he observed, "is the bloody sceptre by which England is ruled.
      From the palace to the prison is a step&mdash;from the prison to the
      scaffold another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "King Henry the Eighth gave it plenty of employment," observed Winwike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied Renard; "and his daughter, Queen Mary, will not suffer it
      to remain idle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many a head will, doubtless, fall (and justly), in consequence of the
      late usurpation," remarked the warder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first to do so now rests within that building," rejoined Renard,
      glancing at the Beauchamp Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your worship, of course, means the Duke of Northumberland, since his
      grace is confined there," returned the warder. "Well, if she is spared
      who, though placed foremost in the wrongful and ill-advised struggle, was
      the last to counsel it, I care not what becomes of the rest. Poor lady
      Jane! Could our eyes pierce yon stone walls," he added, pointing to the
      Brick Tower, "I make no doubt we should discover her on her knees. She
      passes most of her time, I am informed, in prayer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" ejaculated Renard. And he half muttered, "She shall either
      embrace the Romish faith, or die by the hand of the executioner."
    </p>
    <p>
      Winwike made no answer to the observation, and affected not to hear it,
      but he shuddered at the look that accompanied it&mdash;a look that brought
      to mind all he heard of the mysterious and terrible individual at his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the sun was high in heaven, and the whole fortress astir. A
      flourish of trumpets was blown on the Green, and a band of minstrels
      issued from the portal of the Coalharbour Tower. The esquires, retainers,
      pages, and servitors of the various noblemen, lodged within the palace,
      were hurrying to and fro, some hastening to their morning meal, others to
      different occupations. Everything seemed bright and cheerful. The light
      laugh and the merry jest reached the ear of the listeners. Rich silks and
      costly stuffs, mixed with garbs of various-coloured serge, with jerkins
      and caps of steel, caught the eye. Yet how much misery was there near this
      smiling picture! What sighs from those in captivity responded to the
      shouts and laughter without! Queen Mary arose and proceeded to matins in
      Saint John's Chapel. Jane awoke and addressed herself to solitary prayer;
      while Northumberland, who had passed a sleepless night, pacing his dungeon
      like a caged tiger, threw himself on his couch, and endeavoured to shut
      out the light of day and his own agonizing reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Renard and the warder had descended from the White Tower and
      proceeded to the Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that person beneath the Beauchamp Tower gazing so inquisitively at
      its barred windows?" demanded the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the crow scenting the carrion&mdash;it is Mauger the headsman,"
      answered Winwike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?" replied Renard; "I would speak with him."

    <h2>
      V.&mdash;HOW THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND WAS ARRAIGNED OF HIGH TREASON IN
      WESTMINSTER HALL; AND HOW HE MADE FOUR REQUESTS AFTER THE JUDGMENT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>losely confined
      within the Beauchamp Tower, and treated with great rigour, it was almost a
      satisfaction to the Duke of Northumberland to be informed, after nearly a
      fortnight's immediate prisonment, that his trial would take place on the
      18th of August. Though he anticipated the result, and had no hope of
      escaping the block, the near approach of death did not cast him down, but
      on the contrary served to reassure his firmness, which of late, shaken by
      his altered state of health, and intense mental anxiety, had in some
      degree failed him. The last few weeks had wonderfully changed his
      appearance. Heretofore, though past the middle term of life, he exhibited
      no symptom of decay. His frame was strong and muscular&mdash;his
      deportment lofty and majestic&mdash;his eye piercing as the eagle's. He
      was now shrunken&mdash;bent&mdash;with the gait and look of an old man. On
      the intelligence above mentioned being communicated to him, he all at once
      shook off this feebleness. His eye regained its fire, his frame its
      strength and lofty bearing; and if his figure was wasted and his brow
      furrowed, it detracted nothing from his dignity. Aware that his enemies
      would sit in judgment upon him, he determined to confront them boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day appointed for the arraignment arrived, the Duke prepared
      himself betimes. He was habited in a doublet of black velvet, and wore the
      collar of the order of the garter. His eldest son, John Dudley, Earl of
      Warwick, and the Marquess of Northampton, were to be tried with him, and
      on the morning in question the three noblemen met for the first time since
      their imprisonment. The meeting took place in a spacious chamber on the
      first floor, now used, as has been already observed, as a mess-room, but
      then as a hall in which the prisoners were separately introduced at stated
      intervals to take exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing his arms round his son's neck, and with difficulty repressing his
      emotion, the Duke implored his forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what, my lord?" demanded the young nobleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the great wrong I have done you in placing you in this fearful
      jeopardy," answered Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have done me no wrong, my lord," replied his son. "My wishes were as
      strongly in favour of the cause as yours, and I am therefore as culpable
      as yourself. And as I should have been the first to congratulate you on
      its success, so I ought to be the last to reproach you with its failure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless the fault <i>is</i> mine, and mine only," replied the Duke.
      "I was the originator of the scheme&mdash;the planner of the snare into
      which we have fallen&mdash;and if you perish, your death will be at my
      door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think not of me, father," replied the young man. "The life I received
      from you, I will gladly lay down for you. If you desire my forgiveness you
      shall have it. But I ought rather to ask your's. And, at all events, I
      entreat your blessing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven bless you, my son, and have mercy on us both," exclaimed
      Northumberland, fervently. "If the humblest supplication could move our
      judges in your favour it should not be wanting. But I well know they are
      inexorable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather die a thousand deaths than you so demeaned yourself,"
      replied Warwick. "Ask nothing from them but a speedy judgment. We go to a
      condemnation, not a trial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my lord," added Northampton; "we have nothing to hope, and
      therefore nothing to fear. The game is lost, and we must pay the penalty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, my lord," rejoined Northumberland, embracing him, "and we will
      discharge it to the uttermost. Would that my life could pay for all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since it cannot be, my lord," replied Northampton, "e'en let us meet our
      fate like men, and give our enemies no additional triumph. To see your
      grace so well reconciled to your fate, must encourage those who have lost
      so little in comparison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so well reconciled to it," replied the Duke, "that I scarcely desire
      to be restored to my former condition. And yet," he added, sternly, "I
      would gladly enjoy my former power for an hour, to be avenged on one
      man.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "His name?" inquired the Earl of Warwick, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simon Renard," replied the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep silence ensued, which was broken at length by Northumberland, who
      inquired from the officer in attendance if he knew aught of the Queen's
      intentions towards Lady Jane Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her highness, it is said, is inclined to pardon her, in consideration of
      her youth," replied the officer, "but her councillors are averse to such
      leniency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are my enemies," rejoined the Duke&mdash;"Again my crimes are
      visited on an innocent head."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, a small arched door near one of the recesses was opened,
      and a warder announced that the escort was ready to convey the prisoners
      to Westminster Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preceded by the officer, the Duke and his companions descended a short
      spiral stone staircase, and, passing under an arched doorway, on either
      side of which was drawn up a line of halberdiers, entered upon the Green.
      The whole of this spacious' area, from Saint Peter's Chapel to the
      Lieutenant's lodgings&mdash;from the walls of the tower they had quitted,
      to those of the White Tower, was filled with spectators. Every individual
      in the fortress, whose duty did not compel his attendance elsewhere, had
      hastened thither to see the great Duke of Northumberland proceed to his
      trial; and so intense was the curiosity of the crowd, that it was with
      great difficulty that the halberdiers-could keep them from pressing upon
      him. On the Duke's appearance something like a groan was uttered, but it
      was instantly checked. Northumberland was fully equal to this trying
      moment. Aware of his own unpopularity,&mdash;aware that amid that vast
      concourse he had not one well-wisher, but that all rejoiced in his
      downfall,&mdash;he manifested no discomposure, but marched with a step so
      majestic, and glanced around with a look, so commanding, that those who
      were near him involuntarily shrunk before his regards. The deportment of
      Northampton was dignified and composed&mdash;that of the Earl of Warwick
      fierce and scornful. Lord Clinton, the Constable of the Tower, and the
      Lieutenant, Sir John Gage, now advanced to meet them, and the former
      inquired from Northumberland whether he had any request to make that could
      be complied with. Before an answer could be returned by the Duke, an old
      woman broke through the ranks of the guard, and regardless of the menaces
      with which she was assailed confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know me?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," replied the Duke, a shudder passing over his frame. "You are
      Gunnora Braose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," she answered. "I am, moreover, foster-mother to the Duke of
      Somerset&mdash;the great, the good Lord Protector, whom you, murderer and
      traitor, destroyed eighteen months ago. By your false practices, he was
      imprisoned in the tower you have just quitted; he was led forth as you
      are, but he was not received like you with groans and hootings, but with
      tears. He was taken to Westminster Hall where you sat in judgment upon
      him, and condemned him, and where he will this day testify against you.
      Tremble! perfidious Duke, for a fearful retribution is at hand. He, whom
      you have destroyed, sleeps in yon chapel. Ere many days have passed, you
      will sleep beside him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace! woman," cried Lord Clinton, interfering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>will</i> speak," continued Gunnora, "were they the last words I had
      to utter. Behold!" she cried, waving a handkerchief before the Duke, "this
      cloth was dipped in thy victim's blood. It is now beginning to avenge
      itself upon thee. Thou goest to judgment&mdash;to death&mdash;to death&mdash;ha!
      ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remove her!" cried Lord Clinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To judgment!&mdash;to judgment!&mdash;to death!" reiterated the old woman
      with a wild exulting laugh, as she was dragged away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Order being restored, the procession set forth. First, marched a band of
      halberdiers; then came a company of arquebussiers, armed with calivers.
      Immediately before the Duke walked the gentleman-jailor, who, according to
      a custom then observed towards those charged with high treason, carried
      the axe with the edge turned <i>from</i> the prisoner. On either side of
      Northumberland and his companions walked an officer of the guard, with a
      drawn sword in his hand. The rear of the cortege was brought up by two
      other bands of halberdiers and arquebussiers. Taking its course across the
      green, and passing beneath the gloomy portal of the Bloody Tower, the
      train entered an archway at the left of the By-ward Tower, and crossing
      the drawbridge, drew up at the head of the stairs leading to the river.
      Here several boats were in readiness to convey them to their destination.
      As soon as the Duke and his companions had embarked, the gentleman-jailor
      followed them, and stationed himself at the head of the boat, holding the
      gleaming instrument of death in the same position as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, surrounded by the escort, and attended by a multitude of
      smaller vessels, filled with curious spectators, the prisoners were
      conveyed to Westminster. No sympathy was exhibited for the Duke's fallen
      state; but, on the contrary, the spectacle seemed to afford more
      satisfaction to the observers than the gorgeous pageant he had so recently
      devised for their entertainment. Northumberland was not insensible to this
      manifestation of dislike, though he made no remark upon it; but he could
      not avoid noticing, with a sensation of dread, one boat following in his
      wake, as near as the escort would permit, in which was seated an old
      woman, waving a bloodstained handkerchief, and invoking vengeance upon his
      head. Many of the wherries pressed round her to ascertain the cause of her
      vociferations, and as soon as it was understood who she was, other voices
      were added to hers. On landing at the stairs near Westminster Hall, the
      escort first disembarked, and then the Duke and his companions, who,
      preceded by the gentleman-jailor in the same order as before, were
      conducted to the place of trial. In the midst of this magnificent and
      unrivalled hall, which William Rufus, who built it, affirmed was "but a
      bedchamber in comparison of what he meant to make," was erected an immense
      scaffold, hung with black cloth. At the upper extremity was a canopy of
      state, embroidered with the royal escutcheon in gold; and on either side
      were twenty-seven seats, each emblazoned with armorial bearings woven in
      silver. The canopy was reserved for the Duke of Norfolk, Lord High Steward
      of England; the chairs for the different peers appointed to hear the
      arraignment of the prisoners. At the lower extremity was the bar. On
      entering the hall, the Duke and his companions were conducted into a small
      chamber on the right, where they were detained till the arrival of the
      judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time, they were summoned by an usher, and following the
      attendant through two long files of halberdiers, the Duke slowly but
      firmly ascended the steps of the scaffold. On arriving at the bar, he
      bowed profoundly to the assemblage, and every peer, except the Duke of
      Norfolk, immediately arose, and acknowledged the salutation. Drawing
      himself up to his full height. Northumberland then glanced sternly around
      the tribunal. Not one of those upon whom his gaze fell but&mdash;scarcely
      a month ago&mdash;had trembled at his nod. Wherever be looked, his glance
      encountered an enemy. There sat Arundel, Pembroke, Shrewsbury, Rich,
      Huntingdon, Darcy,&mdash;the abettors in his treason, now his judges. On
      the right of the Lord High Steward sat Bishop Gardiner, in his capacity of
      Lord Chancellor: on the left, Lord Paget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Northumberland's indictment having been read, he thus addressed the court:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lords," he said, "I here profess my faith and obedience to the Queen's
      highness, whom I confess to have most grievously offended, and beyond the
      hope of pardon. I shall not attempt to say anything in my own defence. But
      I would willingly have the opinion of the court in two points."
    </p>
    <p>
      "State them,'" said the Duke of Norfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First then," replied Northumberland, "I desire to know, whether the
      performance of an act by the authority of the sovereign and the council,
      and by warrant of the great seal of England, can be construed as treason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most undoubtedly, in your grace's case," replied the Duke of Norfolk;
      "inasmuch as the great seal whence your authority was derived was not the
      seal of the lawful Queen of the realm, but that of a usurper, and
      therefore no warrant." Northumberland bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am answered," he said. "And now to the second point on which I would be
      resolved. Is it fitting or right," he continued, glancing fiercely around,
      "that those persons who are equally culpable with myself, and by whose
      letters and commandments I have been directed in all I have done, should
      be my judges, or pass upon my trial at my death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grant that others are as deeply implicated in this case as your Grace,"
      replied the Duke of Norfolk; "yet so long as no attainder is of record
      against them, they are able in the law to pass upon any trial, and cannot
      be challenged, except at the Queen's pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," replied Northumberland, bowing coldly; "and since it is
      useless to urge any reasonable matter, I will at once confess the
      indictment, entreating your Grace to be a means of mercy for me unto the
      Queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Judgment was then pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke once more addressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beseech you, my lords," he said, "all to be humble suitors for me to
      the queens highness, that she grant me four requests." Most of the peers
      having signified their assent by a slight inclination of the head, he
      proceeded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, that I may have that death which noblemen have had in times past,
      and not the other. Secondly," and his voice faltered, "that her highness
      will be gracious to my children, who may hereafter do her good service,
      considering that they went by my commandment, who am their father, and not
      of their own free wills."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not include me in your solicitation, my lord," interrupted the Earl of
      Warwick, haughtily. "I neither ask mercy, nor would accept it at the
      Queen's hands; and prefer death to her service. What I have done, I have
      done on no authority save my own, and were it to do again, I would act in
      like manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rash boy, you destroy yourself," cried the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed, my lord," observed the Duke of Norfolk, compassionately; "your
      son's indiscreet speech will not weigh with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirdly, then," rejoined Northumberland, "I would entreat that I may have
      appointed to me some learned man for the instruction and quieting of my
      conscience. And fourthly, that her highness will send two of the council
      to commune with me, to whom I will declare such matters as shall be
      expedient for her and the state. And thus I beseech you all to pray for
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubt it not, my lord," rejoined Norfolk; "and doubt not, also, that your
      requests shall be duly represented to the Queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Add, if it please your grace," pursued Northumberland, "a few words in
      favour of the unhappy Lady Jane Dudley, who, as is well known to many now
      sitting in judgment upon me, so far from aspiring to the crown, was by
      enticement and force compelled to accept it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke then retired, and the Marquess of Northampton having advanced to
      the bar, and pleaded to his indictment, sentence was passed on him
      likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      His example was followed by the Earl of Warwick, who heard his
      condemnation pronounced with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, my lords," he said, when the sentence was uttered, "and
      crave only this favour of the Queen, that as the goods of those condemned
      to death are totally confiscated, her highness will be pleased to let my
      debts be paid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, he bowed to the tribunal and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the trial, an immense concourse had assembled in the open space in
      front of the hall, waiting in breathless impatience for the result. It was
      not till towards evening that this was known. The great doors were then
      thrown open, and a troop of halberdiers came forth to clear the way for
      the prisoners. A deep dead silence prevailed, and every eye was bent upon
      the doorway. From beneath it marched the gentleman-jailor, carrying the
      axe with its edge <i>towards</i> the prisoners. This was enough. The mob
      knew they were condemned, and expressed their satisfaction by a sullen
      roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the voice of a woman was heard exclaiming, "See ye not the axe?
      See ye not the edge turned towards him? He is condemned. The slayer of the
      good Duke of Somerset is condemned. Shout! Shout!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And in obedience to her commands, a loud cry was raised by the mob. Amid
      this clamour and rejoicing, Northumberland and his companions were
      conveyed to their boat, and so to the Tower.

    <h2>
      VI.&mdash;BY WHAT MEANS THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND WAS RECONCILED TO THE
      CHURCH OF ROME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal days having
      elapsed since the trial, and no order made for his execution, the Duke of
      Northumberland, being of a sanguine temperament, began to indulge hopes of
      mercy. With hope, the love of life returned, and so forcibly, that he felt
      disposed to submit to any humiliation to purchase his safety. During this
      time, he was frequently visited by Bishop Gardiner, who used every
      persuasion to induce him to embrace the Romish faith. Northumberland,
      however, was inflexible on this point, but, professing the most, sincere
      penitence, he besought the Bishop, in his turn, to intercede with the
      Queen in his behalf. Gardiner readily promised compliance, in case his
      desires were acceded to; but as the Duke still continued firm in his
      refusal, he declined all interference. "Thus much I will promise," said
      Gardiner, in conclusion; "your grace shall have ample time for reflection,
      and if you place yourself under the protection of the Catholic church, no
      efforts shall be wanting on my part to move the Queen's compassion towards
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, the officer on guard suddenly threw open the door of his cell,
      and admitting an old woman, closed it upon them. The Duke, who was reading
      at the time by the light of a small lamp set upon a table, raised his eyes
      and beheld Gunnora Braose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why have you come hither?" he demanded. "But I need no task. You have
      come to gratify your vengeance with a sight of my misery. Now you are
      satisfied, depart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am come partly with that intent, and partly with another," replied
      Gunnora. "Strange as it may sound, and doubtful, I am come to save you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To save me!" exclaimed Northumberland, starting. "How?&mdash;But&mdash;no!&mdash;no!
      This is mockery. Begone, accursed woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no mockery," rejoined Gunnora. "Listen to me, Duke of
      Northumberland. I love vengeance well, but I love my religion better. Your
      machinations brought my foster-son, the Duke of Somerset, to the block,
      and I would willingly see you conducted thither. But there is one
      consideration that overcomes this feeling. It is the welfare of the
      Catholic church. If you become a convert to that creed, thousands will
      follow your example; and for this great good I would sacrifice my own
      private animosity. I am come hither to tell you your life will be spared,
      provided you abandon the Protestant faith, and publicly embrace that of
      Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How know you this?" demanded the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter," replied Gunnora. "I am in the confidence of those, who,
      though relentless enemies of yours, are yet warmer friends to the Church
      of Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Simon Renard and Gardiner!" observed Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      G minora nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now my mission is ended," she said. "Your grace will do well to weigh
      what I have said. But your decision must be speedy, or the warrant for
      your execution will be signed. Once within the pale of the Catholic
      church, you are safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I should be induced to embrace the offer!" said the Duke. "If"&mdash;cried
      Gunnora, her eye suddenly kindling with vindictive fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Woman," rejoined the Duke, "I distrust you. I will die in the faith I
      have lived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," she replied. "I have discharged the only weight I had upon my
      conscience, and can now indulge my revenge freely. Farewell! my lord. Our
      next meeting will be on Tower Hill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" cried Northumberland. "It may be as you represent, though my mind
      misgives me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is but forswearing yourself," observed Gunnora, sarcastically. "Life
      is cheaply purchased at such a price."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretch!" cried the Duke. "And yet I have no alternative. I accede."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sign this then," returned Gunnora, "and it shall be instantly conveyed to
      her highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Northumberland took the paper, and casting his eye hastily over it, found
      it was a petition to the Queen, praying that he might be allowed to recant
      his religious opinions publicly, and become reconciled to the church of
      Rome. "It is in the hand of Simon Renard," he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," replied Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who will assure me if I do this, my life will be spared!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I</i> will," answered the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" cried the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pledge myself to it," replied Gunnora. "Your life would be spared, even
      if your head were upon the block. I swear to you by this cross," she
      added, raising the crucifix that hung at her neck, "if I have played you
      falsely, I will not survive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," replied the Duke, signing the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This shall to the Queen at once," said Gunnora, snatching it with a look
      of ill-disguised triumph. "To-morrow will be a proud day for our church."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with this she quitted the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, the Duke was visited by Gardiner, on whose appearance he
      flung himself on his knees. The bishop immediately raised him, and
      embraced him, expressing his delight to find that he at last saw through
      his errors. It was then arranged that the ceremonial of the reconciliation
      should take place at midnight in Saint John's Chapel in the White Tower.
      When the Duke's conversion was made known to the other prisoners, the
      Marquess of Northampton, Sir Andrew Dudley, (Northumbcrland's brother,)
      Sir Henry Gates, and Sir Thomas Palmer; they all&mdash;with the exception
      of the Earl of Warwick, who strongly and indignantly reprobated his
      father's conduct,&mdash;desired to be included in the ceremonial. The
      proposal being readily agreed to, priests were sent to each of them, and
      the remainder of the day was spent in preparation for the coming rites.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, as had been arranged, they were summoned. Preceded by two
      priests, one of whom bore a silver cross, and the other a large flaming
      wax candle, and escorted by a band of halberdiers, carrying lighted
      torches, the converts proceeded singly, at a slow pace, across the Green,
      in the direction of the White Tower. Behind them marched the three
      gigantic warders, Og, Gog, and Magog, each provided with a torch. It was a
      solemn and impressive spectacle, and as the light fell upon the assemblage
      collected to view it, and upon the hoary walls of the keep. The effect was
      peculiarly striking. Northumberland walked with his arms folded, and his
      head upon his breast, and looked neither to the right nor to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through Coalharbour Gate, the train entered an arched door-way in
      a structure then standing at the south-west of the White Tower. Traversing
      a long winding passage, they ascended a broad flight of steps, at the head
      of which was a gallery leading to the western entrance of the chapel.
      Here, before the closed door of the sacred structure, beneath the arched
      and vaulted roof, surrounded by priests and deacons in rich copes, one of
      whom carried the crosier, while others bore silver-headed staves, attired
      in his amice, stole, pluvial and alb, and wearing his mitre, sat Gardiner
      upon a faldstool. Advancing slowly towards him, the Duke fell upon his
      knees, and his example was imitated by the others. Gardiner then proceeded
      to interrogate them in a series of questions appointed by the Romish
      formula for the reconciliation of a heretic; and the profession of faith
      having been duly made, he arose, took off his mitre, and delivering it to
      the nearest priest, and extended his arms over the converts, and
      pronounced the absolution. With his right thumb he then drew the sign of
      the cross on the Duke's forehead, saying, "<i>Accipe signum crucis</i>."
      and being answered, "<i>Acccpi</i>." he went through the same form with
      the rest. Once more assuming the mitre, with his left hand he took the
      Duke's right, and raised him, saying, "<i>Ingredere in ceclesiam Dei à qua
      incaute alerrasti. Horicsce idola. Respite omnes gravitates et super
      superstitiones hereticus. Cole Deum oninipotcntem et Jesum fillimm ejus,
      et Spiritum Sanctum.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the doors of the chapel were thrown open, and the bishop led
      the chief proselyte towards the altar. Against the massive pillars at the
      east end of the chapel, reaching from their capitals to the base, was hung
      a thick curtain of purple velvet, edged with a deep border of gold.
      Relieved against this curtain stood the altar, covered with a
      richly-ornaincnted antipendium, sustaining a large silver crucifix, and
      six massive candlesticks of the same metal. At a few paces from it, on
      either side, were two other colossal silver candlesticks, containing
      enormous wax lights. On either side were grouped priests with censers,
      from which were diffused the most fragrant odours.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0203.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      As Northumberland slowly accompanied the bishop along the nave, he saw,
      with some misgiving, the figures of Simon Renard and Gunnora emerge from
      behind the pillars of the northern aisle. His glance met that of Renard,
      and there was something in the look of the Spaniard that made him fear he
      was the dupe of a plot&mdash;but it was now too late to retreat. When
      within a few paces of the altar, the Duke again knelt down, while the
      bishop removed his mitre as before, and placed himself in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0033" id="linkimage-0033"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0205.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the whole nave of the church, the aisles, and the circular
      openings of the galleries above, were filled with spectators. A wide
      semicircle was formed around the converts. On the right stood several
      priests. On the left Simon Renard had planted himself, and near to him
      stood Gunnora; while, on the same side against one of the pillars, was
      reared the gigantic frame of Magog. A significant look passed between them
      as Northumberland knelt before the altar. Extending his arms over the
      convert, Gardiner now pronounced the following exhortation:&mdash; "<i>Omnipotens
      sempiterne Deus hanc ovem tuam de faucibus lupi tua virtute subtractam
      paterna recipe, pietate et gregi tuo reforma piâ benignitate ne de familiâ
      tua damno inimicus exultet; sed de conversione et liberatione jus
      ecclesiam ut pia mater de filio reperto gratuletur per Christum Dominum
      nostrum."</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" ejaculated Northumberland.
    </p>
    <p>
      After uttering another prayer, the bishop resumed his mitre, and seating
      himself upon the faldstool, which, in the interim, had been placed by the
      attendants in front of the altar, again interrogated the proselyte:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Homo, abrcnuncias Sathanas et angelos ejus?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Abrenuncio,</i>" replied the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Abrenuncias etiam omnes sectas hereticæ pravitatis?</i>" continued the
      bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Abrenuncio,</i>" responded the convert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Vis esse et vivere in imitate sancto fidei Catholico?</i>" demanded
      Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Volo,</i>" answered the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again taking off his mitre, the bishop arose, and laying his right
      hand upon the head of the Duke, recited another prayer, concluding by
      signing him with the cross. This done, he resumed his mitre, and seated
      himself on the faldstool, while Northumberland, in a loud voice, again
      made a profession of his faith, and abjuration of his errors&mdash;admitting
      and embracing the apostolical ecclesiastical traditions, and all others&mdash;acknowledging
      all the observances of the Roman church&mdash;&mdash;purgatory&mdash;the
      veneration of saints and relics&mdash;the power of indulgences&mdash;promising
      obedience to the Bishop of Rome,&mdash;and engaging to retain and confess
      the same faith entire and invio-lated to the end of his life. "<i>Ago
      talis</i>," he said, in conclusion, "cognoscens veram Catholicam et
      Apostolicum fidem. Anathematizo hic publiée omnem heresem, procipuè illam
      de qua hactenus extiti.<i>" This he affirmed by placing both hands upon
      the book of the holy gospels, proffered him by the bishop, exclaiming,
      "Sic me Deus adjunct, et hoc sancta Dei evangelia!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ceremony was ended, and the proselyte arose. At this moment, he met
      the glance of Renard&mdash;that triumphant and diabolical glance&mdash;its
      expression was not to be mistaken. Northumberland shuddered, he felt that
      he had been betrayed.

      VII.-HOW THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND WAS BEHEADED ON TOWER HILL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hree days after
      Northumberland's reconciliation with the Church of Rome, the warrant for
      his execution was signed by Queen Mary. The fatal intelligence was brought
      him by the lieutenant, Sir John Gage, and though he received it with
      apparent calmness, his heart sank within him. he simply inquired when it
      was to take place, and, being informed on the following day at an early
      hour, he desired to be left alone. As soon as the lieutenant was gone, he
      abandoned himself wholly to despair, and fell into a state bordering on
      distraction. While he was in this frenzied state, the door of his cell
      opened, and the jailor introduced Gunnora Braose and a tall man muffled in
      the folds of an ample black cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretch!" cried the Duke, regarding the old woman fiercely. "You have
      deceived me. But the device shall avail you little. From the scaffold I
      will expose the snare in which I have been taken. I will proclaim my
      Protestant opinions; and my dying declaration will be of more profit to
      that faith than my recent recantation can be to yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace is mistaken," rejoined Gunnora. "I do not deserve your
      reproaches, as I will presently show. I am the bearer of a pardon to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pardon!" exclaimed Northumberland, incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, a pardon," replied the old woman. "The Queen's highness will spare
      your life. But it is her pleasure that her clemency be as public as your
      crime. You will be reprieved on the scaffold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I assured of this," cried Northumberland, eagerly grasping at the
      straw held out to him, "I would exhort the whole multitude to embrace the
      Catholic faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rest satisfied of it, then," replied Gunnora. "May I perish at the same
      moment as yourself if I speak not the truth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom have we here?" inquired the Duke, turning to the muffled personage.
      "The headsman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your enemy," replied the individual, throwing aside his mantle, and
      disclosing the features of Simon Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is but a poor revenge to insult a fallen foe," observed
      Northumberland, disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Revenge is sweet, however obtained," rejoined Renard. "I am not come,
      however, to insult your grace, but to confirm the truth of this old
      woman's statement. Opposed as I am to you, and shall ever be, I would not
      have you forfeit your life by a new and vile apostacy. Abjure the Catholic
      faith, and you will die unpitied by all. Maintain it; and at the last
      moment, when the arm of the executioner is raised, and the axe gleams in
      the air&mdash;when the eyes of thousands are fixed on it&mdash;sovereign
      mercy will arrest the blow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You awaken new hope in my bosom," rejoined the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be true to the faith you have embraced, and fear nothing," continued
      Renard. "You may yet be restored to favour, and a new career of ambition
      will open to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life is all I ask," replied the Duke; "and if that be spared, it shall be
      spent in her majesty's service. My pride is thoroughly humbled. But the
      language you hold to me, M. Renard, is not that of an enemy. Let me think
      that our differences are ended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will be ended to-morrow," replied Renard, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," replied Northumberland. "The first act of the life I receive
      from her highness shall be to prostrate myself at her feet: the next, to
      offer my thanks to you, and entreat your friendship.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush," returned Renard, impatiently. "My friendship is more to be feared
      than my enmity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there is any means of repairing the wrong I have done you," said the
      Duke, turning to Gunnora, "be assured I will do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am content with what your grace has done already," rejoined Gunnora,
      sternly. "You cannot restore the Duke of Somerset to life. You cannot give
      back the blood shed on the scaffold&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I can atone for it," interrupted the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," cried Gunnora, her eyes flashing with vindictive fire, "you <i>can</i>&mdash;fearfully
      atone for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace will not heed her raving," remarked Renard, seeing that
      Northumberland's suspicions were aroused by the old woman's manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can atone for it," continued Gunnora, aware of the impression she had
      produced, and eager to remove it, "by a life of penance. Pass the night in
      prayer for the repose of his soul, and do not omit to implore pardon for
      yourself, and to-morrow I will freely forgive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do as you desire," replied the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must now bid your grace farewell," said Renard. "We shall meet
      to-morrow&mdash;on the scaffold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not part there, I hope," replied Northumberland, forcing a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will rest with your grace&mdash;not me," replied Renard, in a
      freezing tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you accept this from me?" said Northumberland, detaching a jewelled
      ornament from his dress, and offering it to Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will accept nothing from you," replied the old woman. "Yes,&mdash;one
      thing," she added quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is yours," rejoined the Duke. "Name it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall give it me to-morrow," she answered evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is his head you require," observed Renard, with a sinister smile, as
      they quitted the Beauchamp Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have guessed rightly," rejoined the old woman, savagely. "We have him
      in our toils," returned Renard. "He cannot escape. You ought to be content
      with your vengeance, Gunnora. You have destroyed both body and soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am content," she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now to Mauger," said Renard, "to give him the necessary instructions.
      You should bargain with him for Northumberland's head, since you are so
      anxious to possess it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not live to receive it," rejoined Gunnora.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not live!" he exclaimed. "What mean you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter," she replied. "We lose time. I am anxious to finish this
      business. I have much to do to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking their way across the Green, and hastening down the declivity they
      soon arrived at the Bloody Tower. Here they learnt from a warder that
      Manger, since Queen Mary's accession, had taken up his quarters in the
      Cradle Tower, and thither they repaired. Traversing the outer ward in the
      direction of the Lantern Tower, they passed through a wide portal and
      entered the Privy gardens, on the right of which stood the tower in
      question.

    <p>
      As they drew near, they heard the shrill sound produced by the sharpening
      of some steel instrument. Smiling significantly at Gunnora, Renard instead
      of opening the door proceeded to a narrow loop-hole, and looked in. He
      beheld a savage-looking individual seated on a bench near a grindstone. He
      had an axe in one hand, which he had just been sharpening, and was trying
      its edge with his thumb. His fierce blood-shot eyes, peering from beneath
      his bent and bushy brows, were fixed upon the weapon. His dress consisted
      of a doublet of red serge with tight black sleeves, and hose of the same
      colour. His brow was lowering and wrinkled&mdash;the summit of his head
      perfectly bald, but the sides were garnished with long black locks, which
      together with his immense grizzled moustaches, bristling like the whiskers
      of a cat-a-mountain, and ragged beard, imparted a wild and forbidding look
      to his physiognomy. Near him rested a square, solid piece of wood,
      hollowed out on either side to admit the shoulder and head of the person
      laid upon it. This was the block. Had Renard not known whom he beheld,
      instinct would have told him it was the headsman.

    <p>
      Apparently satisfied with the sharpness of the implement, Manger was about
      to lay it aside, when the door opened, and Renard and Gunnora entered the
      chamber. The executioner rose to receive them. He had received a wound in
      his left leg which had crippled the limb, and he got up with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not disturb yourself," said Renard. "My business will be despatched in
      a few seconds. You are preparing I see for the execution to-morrow. What I
      have to say relates to it. The moment the Duke's head is laid upon this
      block," he added, pointing to it, "strike. Give him not a moment's pause.
      Do you hear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," replied Mauger. "But I must have some warrant?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be this your warrant," replied Renard, flinging him a heavy purse. "If
      you require further authority, you shall have it under the Queen's own
      hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I require nothing further, worshipful sir," replied Mauger, smiling
      grimly. "Ere the neck has rested one second upon the block, the head shall
      be off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have also a boon to offer, and an injunction to give," said Gunnora
      taking off the ring given her by the unfortunate Lady Jane, and presenting
      it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your gift is the richer of the two, or I am mistaken, good mistress,"
      said Mauger, regarding the glittering gem with greedy eyes. "What am I to
      do for it? I cannot behead him twice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall stand in front of the scaffold to-morrow," replied Gunnora, "in
      some conspicuous place where you will easily discern me. Before you deal
      the fatal blow, make a sign to me&mdash;thus&mdash;do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly," replied the headsman. "I will not fail you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Renard and the old woman quitted the Cradle Tower, and walked
      together as far as the outer ward, where each took a separate course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last night of his existence was passed by the Duke of Northumberland
      in a most miserable manner. Alternately buoyed up by hope, and depressed
      by fear, he could neither calm his agitation, nor decide upon any line of
      conduct. Allowed, as a matter of indulgence, to remain within the large
      room, he occupied himself in putting the finishing touches to a carving on
      the wall, which he had commenced on his first imprisonment, and had
      wrought at at intervals. This curious sculpture may still be seen on the
      right hand of the fireplace of the mess-room in the Beauchamp Tower, and
      contains his cognizance, a bear and lion supporting a ragged staff
      surrounded by a border of roses., acorns and flowers intermingled with
      foliage.

      Northumberland was employed upon the third line of the quatrain below his
      name, which remains unfinished to the present day, when he was interrupted
      by the entrance of a priest, sent to him by Gardiner. The holy man found
      him in no very favourable frame of mind, but succeeded after some time in
      awakening him to a due sense of his awful situation. The Duke then made a
      full confession of his guilt, and received his shrift. At daybreak, the
      priest departed, with a promise to attend him to the place of execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much tranquillised, the Duke now prepared himself for his last trial. He
      pondered over what he should say on the scaffold, and nerved himself to
      meet his fate, whatever it might be. The Duke of Warwick was then
      introduced to him to receive his blessing, and to take an everlasting
      farewell. After he had received the Duke's embrace, the Earl observed,
      "Would I could change places with you, father. I would say that on the
      scaffold which would shake the bigot Mary on the throne."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke then partook of some refreshment, and wrapped himself in a loose
      robe of grain-coloured damask. At eight o'clock, the Sheriffs of London
      arrived at the Bulwark Gate, and demanded the body of the prisoner. Upon
      this, the Lieutenant, accompanied by four warders, proceeded to the
      Beauchamp Tower, and informed the Duke that all was in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ready, too," replied Northumberland, once more embracing his son,
      whose firmness did not desert him at this trying juncture. And he followed
      the Lieutenant to the Green. Here they found the priest, and a band of
      halberdiers waiting to escort him to the scaffold. Among the by-standers
      stood Simon Renard, who immediately advanced towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How fares your grace!" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well enough, sir, I thank you," answered the Duke, bowing. "I shall be
      better anon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The train then set forward, passing through lines of spectators, until it
      reached the Middle Tower, where it halted, to allow the Lieutenant to
      deliver the prisoner to the Sheriffs and their officers. This ceremony
      over, it again set forward, and passed through the Bulwark Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prepared as the Duke was for some extraordinary sight, he was yet taken
      completely by surprise. The whole area of Tower Hill seemed literally
      paved with human heads. A line of scaffoldings was erected on the brink of
      the moat, and every seat in them was occupied. Never before had so vast an
      assemblage been collected in the same place. The whole of the western
      ramparts of the fortress&mdash;the roof and battlements of the White Tower&mdash;every
      point from which a view of the spectacle could be obtained, was thronged.
      On the Duke's appearance, a murmur of satisfaction pervaded the immense
      host, and he then felt that even if the Queen's pardon should arrive, his
      personal safety was more than questionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Preceded by a band of arquebussiers, armed with calivers, and attended by
      the sheriffs, the priest, and Simon Renard, Northumberland marched slowly
      forward. At length, he reached the scaffold. It was surrounded by seats,
      set aside for persons of distinction; and among its occupants were many of
      his former friends and allies. Avoiding their gaze, the Duke mounted the
      scaffold with a firm foot; but the sight of the vast concourse from this
      elevated point almost unmanned him. As he looked around, another murmur
      arose, and the mob undulated like the ocean. Near the block stood Manger,
      leaning on his axe; his features concealed by a hideous black mask. On the
      Duke's appearance, he fell on his knees, and, according to custom,
      demanded forgiveness, which was granted. Throwing aside his robe, the Duke
      then advanced to the side of the scaffold, and leaning over the eastern
      rail, thus addressed the assemblage:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good people. I am come hither this day to die, as ye know. Indeed, I
      confess to you all that I have been an evil liver, and have done wickedly
      all the days of my life; and, of all, most against the Queen's highness,
      of whom I here openly ask forgiveness," and he reverentially bent the
      knee. "But I alone am not the original doer thereof, I assure you, for
      there were some others who procured the same. But I will not name them,
      for I will now hurt no man. And the chief occasion that I have erred from
      the Catholic faith and true doctrine of Christ, has been through false and
      seditious preachers. The doctrine, I mean, which has continued through all
      Christendom since Christ. For, good people, there is, and hath been ever
      since Christ, one Catholic church; which church hath continued from him to
      his disciples in one unity and concord, and so hath always continued from
      time to time until this day, and yet doth throughout all Christendom,
      ourselves alone excepted. Of this church I openly profess myself to be
      one, and do steadfastly believe therein. I speak unfeignedly from the
      bottom of my heart. And I beseech you all bear witness that I die therein.
      Moreover, I do think, if I had had this belief sooner, I never should have
      come to this pass: wherefore I exhort you all, good people, take example
      of me, and forsake this new doctrine betimes. Defer it not long, lest God
      plague you as he hath me, who now suffer this vile death most deservedly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Concluding by desiring the prayers of the assemblage, he returned slowly,
      and fixing an inquiring look upon Renard, who was standing with his arms
      folded upon his breast, near the block, said in a low tone, "It comes
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not yet time," replied Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was about to kneel down, when he perceived a stir amid the mob in
      front of the scaffold, occasioned by some one waving a handkerchief to
      him. Thinking it was the signal of a pardon, he paused. But he was
      speedily undeceived. A second glance showed him that the handkerchief was
      waved by Gunnora, and was spotted with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting one glance of the bitterest anguish at Renard, he then prostrated
      himself, and the executioner at the same moment raised his hand. As soon
      as the Duke had disposed himself upon the block, the axe flashed like a
      gleam of lightning in the sunshine,&mdash;descended,&mdash;and the head
      was severed from the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seizing it with his left hand, Mauger held it aloft, almost before the
      eyes were closed, crying out to the assemblage, in a loud voice, "Behold
      the head of a traitor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the murmur produced by the released respiration of the multitude, a
      loud shriek was heard, and a cry followed that an old woman had suddenly
      expired. The report was true. It was Gunnora Braose.

      VIII.&mdash;OF QUEEN MARY'S ATTACHMENT TO COURTENAY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ary still
      continued to hold her court within the Tower. Various reasons were
      assigned for this choice of residence; but her real motive was that her
      plans for the restoration of the Catholic religion could be more securely
      concerted within the walls of the fortress than elsewhere. Simon Renard,
      who had become her confidential adviser, and through whom she carried on
      an active correspondence with her cousin, the Emperor Charles the Fifth,
      could here visit her unobserved. Here, also, she secretly received the
      envoy of Pope Julius the Third, Francisco Commendone (afterwards the
      celebrated Cardinal of that name,) and detained him until after the Duke
      of Northumberland's execution, that he might convey intelligence of the
      event, and of the effect produced by it upon the populace, to the Pontiff.
      To Commendone she gave the strongest assurances of her attachment to the
      Church of Rome, and of her fixed determination to restore its worship. But
      at the same time she declared that the change must be gradual, and that
      any undue precipitation would be fatal. In this opinion both Gardiner and
      Renard, who were admitted to the conference, concurred. And satisfied with
      their representations, the envoy departed, overjoyed at the success of his
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other and gentler thoughts, however, than those connected with her
      government, occupied the bosom of the queen. We have already spoken of the
      impression produced upon her at their first interview on the Tower-Green,
      bv the striking figure and noble features of Edward Courtenay, whom she on
      that occasion created Earl of Devonshire, and of the speculations it gave
      rise to among the by-standers. The interest she then felt had been
      subsequently strengthened. And it appeared certain to all who had any
      means of observation, that if she selected a husband, her choice would
      fall upon Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of her attachment was jealously watched by Renard, who having
      other designs in view, secretly opposed it. But aware that Mary, like many
      of her sex, was possessed of a spirit, which would be apt, if thwarted, to
      run into the opposite extreme, he was obliged to proceed with the utmost
      caution. He had, moreover, a strong party against him. From the moment it
      became evident that the Queen regarded the Earl of Devonshire with the
      eyes of affection, all were eager to pay court to him. Among his warmest
      supporters were Gardiner and De Noailles; the latter being mainly
      influenced in his conduct by distrust of the Court of Spain. Renard,
      therefore, stood alone. But though everything appeared against him, he did
      not despair of success. Placing reliance upon Mary's jealous and
      suspicious character, he felt certain of accomplishing his purpose.
      Accordingly, he affected to approve her choice; and with the view of
      carrying out his scheme more effectually, took care to ingratiate himself
      with Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inexperienced as the latter was in the arts of a court, being then only
      twenty-one, and having passed fourteen years of his life in close
      captivity in the Tower, he was easily duped by the wily ambassador; and
      though repeatedly warned against him by De Noailles, who saw through
      Renard's design, he disregarded the caution. Satisfied of the Queen's
      favourable disposition towards him, which was evinced by the most marked
      attention on her part, this young nobleman conceived himself wholly beyond
      the reach of rivalry; and trusting to his personal advantages, and the
      hold he had obtained over the affections of his royal mistress, he gave
      himself little concern about an opposition which he regarded as futile. He
      looked upon himself as certain of the Queen's hand; and but for his own
      imprudence, he would have been actually possessed of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary's meditated alliance was agreeable to all parties, except, as just
      intimated, that of Spain. Already nearly related to the crown by his
      descent from Edward the Fourth, no objection could be raised against her
      favourite on the score of rank; while his frank and conciliating manner,
      combined with his rare endowments of mind and person, won him universal
      regard. Doctor Thomas Wilson, in the funeral oration pronounced over
      Courtenay at Padua in 1556, states, that during his long imprisonment in
      the Tower, "he wholly devoted himself to study, and that neither the <i>augustia
      loci, nec solitudo, nec amissio libertatis, ilium à literis avocarent</i>;
      that he made such progress in philosophy, that no nobleman was equal to
      him in it; that he also explored the <i>mysteria naturae</i>; that he
      entered into the <i>mathematicorum labyrintha</i>; that he was so fond of
      painting, that he could easily and laudably make any one's portrait on a
      <i>tabula</i>; that he was equally attached to music, and had attained in
      it <i>absolutam perfectionem</i>; and that to these acquisitions he added
      the Spanish, French, and Italian languages. In manners he was grave
      without pride; pleasant without levity; prudent in speech; cautious in
      answering; modest in disputing; never boasting of himself, nor excluding
      others; and though familiar with many, yet intimately known to few."
      Allowing for the drawbacks which must necessarily be made from such an <i>éloge</i>,
      enough will remain to prove that his accomplishments were of no common
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the onset of his career, however, Courtenay was assailed by temptations
      which it required more experience of the world to resist. Strictly
      confined from his earliest youth, it may be conceived that when first
      exposed to female fascination, his heart was speedily melted. Hitherto, he
      had only read of beauty. He now felt its full force, and placed no bounds
      to the admiration which the charms of the dames of honour excited within
      his breast. It was upon this point of his character, that Renard justly
      grounded his hopes of alienating the Queen's affections. Encouraging his
      new-born licentiousness, he took care that none of his gallantries should
      fail to reach the ears of his royal mistress. Though of a staid and severe
      character, Mary was not indisposed to make allowances for one so utterly
      inexperienced as Courtenay; and her first direction to Renard was to check
      him. So far from doing this, the artful ambassador incited him to further
      irregularities, and contrived to place new objects in his way. In vain De
      Noailles remonstrated, entreating him at least to be more guarded in his
      conduct. In vain Gardiner sternly rebuked him. He turned a deaf ear alike
      to remonstrance and reproof; and hurried on by the unbridled impetuosity
      of youth, passed from one excess to another. Renard witnessed his conduct
      with secret satisfaction; but he was not prepared for the calmness with
      which the Queen viewed it. She was greatly displeased, yet as her lover
      still seemed passionately devoted to her, she looked upon his conduct as
      resulting from the circumstances of his previous life, and trusting he
      would soon open his eyes to its folly, was content to pardon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard then saw that he must have recourse to stronger measures. As Mary's
      jealousy was not to be easily aroused, he resolved to bring a more
      formidable rival into the held. There was one ready made to his hand. It
      was the Princess Elizabeth. On no one point was the Queen's vanity more
      easily touched than by any reference to the superior charms of her sister.
      Any compliment paid the latter she construed into a slight to herself; and
      she watched with an uneasy glance the effect produced by her in public. So
      sensible was Elizabeth of the Queen's foible, that she kept in the back
      ground as much as possible. Unaware of the mortification he inflicted upon
      his royal mistress, and of the injury he did himself, Courtenay often
      praised the Princess's beauty in terms so rapturous as to call a blush
      into her cheek, while the blood was driven from that of Mary. So
      undisguised was his admiration, that the Queen resolved to remove the
      object of it from her court; and would have done so, but for the artful
      management of Renard, who felt that such a step would ruin his plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before Courtenay had noticed it, the subtle ambassador, well skilled
      in woman's feelings, ascertained the state of Elizabeth's heart, and saw
      that she was not proof against the captivating manners and personal graces
      of the handsome young nobleman. It was not difficult for one possessed of
      so many opportunities as himself to heighten this feeling into a passion;
      and before long he had the satisfaction to find that the princess was
      deeply enamoured of her sister's suitor. Nor was Courtenay less easily
      enthralled. Apprised of his conquest by Renard, instead of resisting it,
      he at once surrendered himself to the snare. Again De Noailles, who saw
      his dangerous position, came to his aid. Again Gardiner rebuked him more
      severely than before. He derided their remonstrances; and heedless of the
      changing manner of the Queen&mdash;heedless also of the peril to which he
      exposed the princess, he scarcely attempted to disguise his passion, or to
      maintain the semblance of love for his royal mistress. Consumed by
      jealousy, Mary meditated some blow which should satisfy her outraged
      feelings; while Renard only waited a favourable opportunity to bring
      matters to a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Affairs being in this state, it chanced one day that Courtenay received a
      summons to the Queen's presence, and instantly repairing thither, he found
      her alone. His reception was so cold, that he was at no loss to understand
      she was deeply offended; and he would have thrown himself at her feet, if
      she had not prevented him by impatiently waving her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent for you, my lord," she said, "for the last time&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the last time, my gracious mistress!" exclaimed Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not interrupt me," rejoined Mary, severely. "I have sent for you to
      tell you that whatever were the feelings I once entertained for you, they
      are now entirely changed. I will not remind you of the favours I have
      shown you&mdash;of the honours I have bestowed on you&mdash;or of the
      greater honours I intended you. I will simply tell you that your
      ingratitude equals your perfidy; and that I banish you henceforth from my
      presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How have I offended your highness?" demanded Courtenay, panic-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>How?</i>" cried Mary, fiercely&mdash;her eyes kindling, and her
      countenance assuming the terrible expression she inherited from her
      father. "Do you affect ignorance of the cause? I have overlooked your
      indiscretions, though I have not been ignorant of them, imputing them to
      youth and inexperience. I have overlooked them, I say, because I thought I
      discovered amid all this vice and folly the elements of a noble nature&mdash;and
      because," and her voice faltered&mdash;"I persuaded myself that you loved
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you no faith in my adjurations of attachment?" cried Courtenay,
      prostrating himself, and endeavouring to take her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None," rejoined the queen, withdrawing her hand; "none whatever. Arise,
      my lord, and do not further degrade yourself. You may love the queen, but
      you do not love the woman.&mdash;You may prize my throne, but you do not
      prize me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wrong me, gracious madam. On my soul you do," rejoined Courtenay. "I
      may have trifled with others, but I have given my heart wholly to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false!" cried Mary, furiously. "You love the princess, my sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay turned very pale. But he instantly recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness is mistaken," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" cried the queen, her anger increasing each moment. "Dare you
      persist in the denial of your falsehood? Dare you tell me to my face that
      you have not breathed words of passion to her? Dare you assert that you
      have not lamented your engagement to me? Dare you say this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your own words shall give you the he, traitor," replied the queen.
      "Here is your letter to her," she added, producing a paper, "wherein you
      tell her so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confusion!" uttered Courtenay, "Renard has betrayed me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this letter your writing?" demanded the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not prevaricate, madam," replied Courtenay; "it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in the face of this you declare you have not deceived me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>have</i> deceived you, gracious madam," replied Courtenay. "But I
      have never ceased to love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord!&mdash;my lord!" exclaimed Mary, in a menacing tone. "Beware how
      you attempt to deceive me further, or as God shall judge me, you shall
      find that the daughter of Henry the Eighth is not to be offended with
      impunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you are terrible in anger, gracious madam," replied Courtenay;
      "but you are also just. Judge me&mdash;condemn me, if you please, but hear
      me: he who gave you that letter,&mdash;Simon Renard,&mdash;counselled me
      to write it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been guilty of folly&mdash;madness&mdash;" rejoined Courtenay&mdash;"but
      not the black perfidy your highness imagines. Dismiss me from your
      presence&mdash;send me into exile&mdash;I deserve any punishment&mdash;but
      do not believe that I have ceased to love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not what <i>you</i> term love, my lord," replied Mary; "but I have
      no idea of sharing the affection of any man with another. Grant, however,
      that you speak the truth, why have you addressed this passionate epistle
      to the Princess Elizabeth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said I was deceived," replied Courtenay. "I cannot excuse
      my conduct&mdash;though I lament it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sincere?" said Mary, who began to be softened by her lover's
      apparent penitence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By what oath shall I confirm my truth?" he replied, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will test it more surely," rejoined the queen, as if struck by a sudden
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In any way your highness thinks proper," returned Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Summon the Princess Elizabeth to our presence instantly," said Mary,
      striking a small bell, the sound of which brought an usher before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Princess Elizabeth!" exclaimed Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, the Princess," repeated the queen. "I will confront you with her. Bid
      the lord chancellor and the ambassadors of Spain and France attend us,"
      she continued to the usher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not what your highness intends," said Courtenay, as the attendant
      departed. "But I will die rather than do aught to prejudice the princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it not, my lord," rejoined Mary, bitterly. "But though I cannot
      punish the perfidy of a lover, I can the disobedience of a subject. If you
      refuse to obey my commands, you will take the consequences."
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay bit his lips to repress the answer that rose to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, the usher returned and announced the Princess Elizabeth,
      as well as Gardiner, Renard, and De Noailles. Instantly perceiving how
      matters stood, the imperial ambassador deemed his own triumph complete,
      and Courtenay's disgrace certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said Mary, addressing Gardiner, "it is no secret to you,
      neither to you, M. Renard, nor to you, M. De Noailles&mdash;that of all
      those proposed to me in marriage&mdash;the Princes of Spain and Portugal,
      the King of the Romans, Cardinal Pole, and others&mdash;I have preferred
      this man, whom I myself have raised to the rank he now holds, and enriched
      with the estates he enjoys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know it, gracious Madam," replied Gardiner, alarmed at the ominous
      commencement, "and we think your highness has made a happy choice, and one
      most acceptable to your subjects. Do we not, M. Renard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ambassador bowed, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The alliance is in all respects agreeable to my sovereign, Henry the
      Second of France," observed De Noailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then if I inform you," pursued Mary, "that the Earl of Devonshire
      has rejected my proposal? What if he has broken his oath of fidelity? What
      if he has cast aside the crown offered him, and smitten by the charms of a
      youthful beauty, abandoned the Queen, who has stooped to raise him to her
      throne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" exclaimed Gardiner and De Noailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken," rejoined Mary, sternly. "You shall hear him avow his
      perfidy with his own lips."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I <i>do</i> hear it," replied De Noailles, looking steadily at
      Courtenay, "I will believe it. But I cannot think him capable of such
      madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," said Gardiner, glancing significantly from beneath his bent
      brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, who on the commencement of the Queen's address had turned very
      pale, could with difficulty maintain her composure. Her agitation did not
      escape the notice of Mary, whose jealousy was increased by the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if I tell you," she continued, "that this false earl has transferred
      his affections to our sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness!" exclaimed Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace!" cried the Queen, fiercely. "And she, well knowing his engagement
      to ourself, has dared to encourage his suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoever told your majesty this, lied in his throat," cried Courtenay. "I
      own myself guilty, but the Princess Elizabeth is no partner to my folly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do well to shield her, my lord," retorted Mary. "But you cannot
      deceive me. She is equally culpable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, more so, if it comes to this," interposed Elizabeth, whose spirit,
      which was quite equal to her sisters, was aroused. "If I had repressed my
      admiration for the Earl of Devonshire, he would have made no advances to
      me. I am the most to blame in this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so;" replied Courtenay. "Let my folly and presumption be visited on
      my own head. I pray your highness to pass sentence on me at once. But do
      not let the Princess suffer for my fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, so!" exclaimed Mary, with a bitter laugh, "I have brought you to your
      confessions at last. If I had before doubted your love for each other,
      your present conduct would have convinced me of it. You shall have your
      request, my lord," she added, turning to Courtenay. "I <i>will</i> pass
      sentence upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold, madam," cried Gardiner. "Before the sentence is passed and
      irrevocable, reflect&mdash;if only for one moment. You are a great queen,
      and the daughter of a great king. But the rashness of one moment may
      annihilate all your future peace, destroy the hopes of your people, and
      the prosperity of your reign. The conduct of the Earl of Devonshire is
      unpardonable, I allow. But for your own sake&mdash;for the sake of your
      kingdom&mdash;not for his&mdash;I beseech you to overlook it. That he
      loves you, I am assured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him declare as much," said Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me, then," replied Courtenay, throwing himself at the-Queen's feet.
      "I bitterly repent my rashness; and though I can never hope to be restored
      to the place I once held in your Majesty's affections, I shall never cease
      to reproach myself&mdash;never cease to love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was visibly moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I thought you sincere?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer for his sincerity," said Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I," added De Noailles. "She relents," he continued in a whisper to
      Courtenay. "Improve the advantage you have gained."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grant me an instant's private audience with your Majesty," implored
      Courtenay; "and I feel certain I can remove all your doubts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord," rejoined Mary. "As our rupture has been public, our
      reconciliation (if it takes place,) shall be public, also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must never take place," remarked Renard, in an under tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace, sir," said the Queen, aloud. "As far as our government is
      concerned, we are content to follow your counsel. But in matters of the
      heart we shall follow its dictates alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty is in the right," observed Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Declare, my lord," pursued Mary, addressing Courtenay, "in the presence
      of these gentlemen, in that of our sister&mdash;<i>rival</i> we ought to
      say,&mdash;that you have deceived her, and, though your conduct may have
      misled her,&mdash;have never swerved from your devotion to ourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Queen pronounced these words, Renard's keen glance wandered from
      Courtenay to Elizabeth. The latter was violently agitated, and seemed to
      await the Earl's answer as if her fate hung upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you assert this, my lord?" demanded Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hesitate, and you are lost, and so is the Princess," whispered De
      Noailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Courtenay could reply, Elizabeth fainted and would have fallen, if
      Renard had not flown to her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Summon our maids of honour, and let her be instantly cared for," said
      Mary, with a look of ill-disguised satisfaction. "My lord," she added to
      Courtenay, "you are forgiven."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Earl hastily, and with some confusion, expressed his thanks, while, in
      obedience to the Queen's mandate, Elizabeth was removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, my lord," said Mary to him, "I must pass from my own affairs to
      those of my kingdom. I will not detain you further&mdash;nor you, M. De
      Noailles. But I must crave your attendance, my lord, for a few minutes,"
      she added, turning to Gardiner, "and yours, M. Renard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness may always command my best counsel," replied the latter, in
      a slightly sarcastic tone&mdash;"provided you will act upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, my lord," said Mary, extending her hand to Courtenay, which he
      pressed to his lips. "I shall walk upon the Tower Green in an hour, and
      shall expect you there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will attend your Majesty," replied Courtenay. And accompanied by De
      Noailles, he quitted the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have had a narrow escape, my lord," remarked the French Ambassador,
      as they traversed the long gallery together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So narrow that I thought I had lost all chance of the crown," replied
      Courtenay. "It is the work of that perfidious Simon Renard. But if I live
      an hour, I will requite him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the victor, my lord," returned De Noailles. "Maintain your
      present position, and you may defy his utmost malice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tarry with me a moment, M. De Noailles," said Courtenay, "and you shall
      see how I will avenge myself upon him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prudence, my good lord&mdash;prudence," replied De Noailles. "Your
      rashness has already put you once in his power. Do not let it do so a
      second time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will punish his treachery, if it costs me my life," replied Courtenay.

      IX.&mdash;OF THE DUEL BETWEEN COURTENAY AND SIMON RENARD; AND HOW IT WAS
      INTERRUPTED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>
      eanwhile, a long discussion was carried on between Mary and her
      councillors, as to the best means of effecting the entire restoration of
      the Romish religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a letter from Cardinal Pole," observed the Queen, "wherein his
      Eminence urges me to adopt no half measures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will not be safe to do so as matters now stand, gracious madam,"
      replied Gardiner. "You must proceed cautiously. The noxious weed, heresy,
      has taken too deep a root in this country to be forcibly extirpated. I
      need not remind you of the murmurs that followed the celebration of mass
      in the chapel in the White Tower, for the repose of the King your brothers
      soul&mdash;of Cranmer's vehement opposition&mdash;of the lord mayor's
      remonstrance, because mass was sung in another chapel in the city&mdash;of
      the riot for a similar cause in Smithfield&mdash;of the dagger thrown at
      Doctor Bourne, when he preached at Saint Paul's Cross, and inveighed
      against the deprivation of our prelates during the late reign. Your
      Majesty did wisely to declare, at my suggestion, that although your
      conscience is stayed in matters of religion, yet you meant not to compel
      and constrain other men's consciences. Abide by this declaration a little
      longer. The two chief opponents of our religion, Ridley and Latimer, are
      already prisoners in the fortress, and Cranmer will be speedily brought
      hither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So speedily, my lord, that he shall be lodged within it today," replied
      Mary. "The order is already signed for his committal on a charge of high
      treason for counselling our disinheritance, and aiding the Duke of
      Northumberland with horse and men against us in the revolt of the Lady
      Jane Grey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will your highness have him arraigned?" asked Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After our coronation," replied Mary; "when Lady Jane Grey and her husband
      shall also be tried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suffolk is already liberated," remarked Renard; "and yet he was more
      deeply implicated than Cranmer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied Mary; "but he is not so dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The counsel of my master, the emperor," rejoined Renard, "as I have more
      than once stated to your Highness, is to spare none of the rebels&mdash;above
      all, the Lady Jane Grey, who, though she may have been the instrument of
      others, is yet in the eyes of the people the principal offender."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Lady Jane!" exclaimed Mary, in a compassionate tone. "She is very
      young&mdash;very beautiful. I would rather reconcile her to our church
      than doom her to the block."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not despair of being able to accomplish her conversion," said
      Gardiner, "though she is an obstinate heretic. I have appointed to-morrow
      for a conference with her on the subject of her religion, and I trust to
      be able to convince her of her errors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With your lordship's permission, I will attend the conference," said
      Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all means," replied Gardiner. "It will take place in the Beauchamp
      Tower. Her husband, Lord Guilford Dudley, has become a proselyte, and they
      will be both present at the disputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave the care of her soul in your hands, my lord," replied Mary. "And
      now I must to my own devotions."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, she dismissed them, and proceeded to an oratory, where she was
      joined by her confessor, Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      On issuing from the audience-chamber, Renard perceived De Noailles and
      Courtenay pacing the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have waited for you, sir,'' said the latter, advancing to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sorry to have detained your lordship so long," replied Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apologies are needless," rejoined Courtenay. "M. Renard, you are a
      double-faced villain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rail on my lord, and welcome," replied Renard, contemptuously. "Your
      ill-humour has no effect on me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coward! will not that move you?" cried Courtenay, taking off his glove,
      and striking him with it in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Renard fiercely, and half-unsheathing his sword. "Follow
      me, my lord, and you shall find me as prompt to avenge an insult as you
      can be to offer one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," interposed De Noailles, "and you, M. Renard, I warn you before
      you proceed further in this quarrel, that it will deeply offend the
      queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not my seeking," replied Renard, sternly. "But since it is forced
      upon me, I will not be stayed. As his lordship has found no difficulty in
      duping her majesty with a feigned passion, so, if he survives, he may
      readily make out his case by an equally false statement that I was the
      aggressor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insolent!" cried Courtenay. "Fool that I was to place any faith in one in
      whom the whole perfidy of his country seems concentred. Follow me, and
      quickly, or I will repeat the blow&mdash;unless," he added with bitter
      scorn, "like your own arrogant but cowardly nation you prefer avenging it
      by assassination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cowardice will be yours, my lord," rejoined Renard, haughtily, "if
      you attempt to repeat the blow&mdash;nay, if you tarry here longer, I
      shall think you desire to attract the attention of some of her majesty's
      attendants, and by causing us to be arrested, contrive to escape my
      vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trust me, sir, I have no such intention," replied Courtenay. "An
      Englishman never deals a blow without allowing his adversary to return it.
      M. De Noailles, I request your attendance at the duel. It will be a mortal
      combat&mdash;for I will neither give mercy nor receive it from this
      perfidious villain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, my lord, if I refuse your request," replied De Noailles. "I
      pledge my word that I will not interrupt you, nor cause you to be
      interrupted during the adjustment of your differences. But I will be no
      party to the duel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please," replied Courtenay. "Come then, sir," he added, turning to
      Renard, "and let the recollection of the insult I have offered you be
      fresh in your memory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. De Noailles," said Renard, "I take you to witness before I depart,
      that I have not sought this quarrel. Whatever ensues, you will avouch the
      truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly," replied De Noailles. "Whither are you going?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the palace-garden," replied Courtenay. "It is the only place in the
      Tower, where we can be free from interruption. Beneath the trees we shall
      be unobserved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lead on then, my lord," cried Renard, impatiently. "The affair ought to
      have been arranged by this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily quitting the corridor, they descended the grand staircase, and
      traversing with rapid steps a long suite of apartments, passed through a
      small door opening from the range of building called the Queen's gallery,
      upon the privy garden. At the western angle of this garden stood a grove
      of trees, and thinking themselves unobserved they hastened towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced however at this moment that Xit was passing along one of the
      walks, and struck by their furious looks he immediately conjectured their
      errand, and being, as has before been shown, of an inquisitive turn,
      determined to watch them, and with this view struck into a shrubbery,
      which effectually screened him from observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the grove, Renard instantly divested himself of his cloak, and
      drawing his rapier and dagger, placed himself in an attitude of defence.
      Courtenay did not remove his mantle, and therefore he was in readiness
      before his adversary. The preliminary forms always observed by the
      combatants of the period, being gone through, the conflict commenced with
      great fury on the side of Courtenay, and with equal animosity, but more
      deliberation, on that of Renard. As the latter was the most perfect
      swordsman of his time, he felt little doubt as to the result of the combat&mdash;but
      still the fury of the Earl was so irresistible that he broke through his
      surest wards. In one of these furious passes Renard received a slight
      wound in the arm, and roused by the pain, he forgot his cautious system,
      and returned Courtenay's thrusts with others equally desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that he was no match for his antagonist, who was evidently his
      superior both in force and skill, the Earl now determined to bring the
      combat to a close, before his strength should be further exhausted.
      Collecting all his energies, he dashed upon Renard with such impetuosity,
      that the latter was compelled to retreat, and his foot catching against
      the root of a tree, he fell, and lay at the mercy of his antagonist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strike!" he cried. "I will never yield."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Courtenay. "I will not take this advantage. Arise, and renew
      the combat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your courtesy is like your attachment, misplaced, my lord," replied
      Renard, springing to his feet, and preparing to attack him. "Look to
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The combat recommenced with fresh fury, and must have speedily terminated
      fatally, if a sudden interruption had not occurred. Alarmed by the deadly
      nature of the strife, and thinking he should gain credit with the queen if
      he prevented any accident to her favourite, Xit no sooner beheld the
      swords drawn, than he ran off as swiftly as he could to the garden-gate,
      near the Lanthorn Tower, where he know Og was stationed. The giant did not
      require to be bid twice to accompany him; but grasping his immense
      halbert, hurried in the direction of the fight, and reached the grove just
      as it had recommenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combatants were so occupied with each other, and so blinded with rage,
      that they did not hear his approach. Og, however, soon made them sensible
      of his presence. Bidding them in a voice of thunder lay down their arms,
      and finding himself wholly disregarded, he rushed between them, and
      seizing each by the doublet, hurled them forcibly backwards&mdash;swearing
      lustily that if either advanced another footstep, he would fell him to the
      ground with his partizan. By this time Xit, who had come up, drew his
      sword, and seconded the giant's threat, adding with his usual coxcombical
      dignity, "My lords, I command you, in the Queen's name, to deliver up your
      weapons to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, he took off his cap, and strutting up to Courtenay, demanded
      his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if I refuse it, sirrah?" said the earl, who in spite of his
      indignation, could scarcely help laughing at the dwarf's assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lordship, I am assured, will not compel me to enforce its delivery,"
      replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not," replied Courtenay, delivering the weapon to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not fail to report your magnanimity to my royal mistress,"
      returned Xit. "Now yours, worshipful sir," he added, to Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it," replied the ambassador, flinging his rapier on the ground. "It
      is fit that an affair so ridiculously begun, should have such a ridiculous
      termination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not ended, sir," rejoined Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will note that, Magog," interposed Xit. "His lordship says it is not
      ended. Her Majesty must hear of this. I take upon myself to place you both
      in arrest. Attach their persons, Magog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This insolence shall not go unpunished," cried Courtenay, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heed him not, Magog," whispered Xit. "I am sure her highness will approve
      our conduct. At all events, I take the responsibility of the arrest upon
      myself&mdash;though I promise thee, if there is any reward, thou shalt
      share it. I arrived at a critical minute for your lordship," he added, in
      an under tone to Courtenay. "Your adversary's blade was within an inch of
      your breast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace, knave," cried Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring them along, Magog," said Xit, "while I run to the palace to apprise
      her Majesty of the occurrence, and ascertain her pleasure concerning
      them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" exclaimed Courtenay. "Take this purse, and keep silence on the
      subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord," replied Xit, with an offended look, "I am above a bribe.
      Had your lordship&mdash;but no matter. Magog, you will answer for their
      peaceable conduct. I am off to the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he hurried away, while the giant followed at a slow pace with
      Courtenay and Renard.

    <h2>
      X.&mdash;OF THE CONFERENCE HELD BETWEEN BISHOP GARDINER AND LADY JANE GREY
      IN THE BEAUCHAMP TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring all this
      time, Jane was kept a close prisoner in the Brick Tower, and neither
      allowed to hold any intercourse with her husband, nor to correspond with
      him. Heart-breaking as the deprivation was to her in the first instance,
      she became in some degree reconciled to it, on learning from her jailor,&mdash;who
      displayed as much humanity towards her as was consistent with his office,&mdash;that
      he bore his fate with the utmost fortitude and resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entertaining no hopes of mercy, Jane's whole time was past in preparation
      for her end. Except the few hours of refreshment actually required by
      nature, every moment was devoted to the most intense application, or to
      fervent prayer. By degrees, all trace of sorrow vanished from her
      features, and they assumed a spiritualized and almost angelic expression.
      Lovely as she was before, she looked far more lovely now&mdash;or rather
      her beauty was of a more refined and exalted character. She was frequently
      visited by the queen's confessor, Feckenham, who used every effort to
      induce her to renounce her religion,&mdash;but in vain. When told that the
      sure way to her Majesty's favour would be to embrace the faith of Rome&mdash;she
      replied that, anxious as she was to obtain the queen's forgiveness, she
      could not purchase it at the price of her salvation, and that the only
      favour she desired was to pass the brief residue of her days unmolested.
      Northumberland's apostacy was a terrible shock to her. Feckenham brought
      the intelligence, and boasted of the convert the Catholic Church had
      gained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may have induced the Duke to recant with his lips, sir," replied
      Jane; "but of this I am assured, he died a Protestant in heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be so," rejoined Feckenham. "He was hypocrite enough to act thus.
      It is enough for us that he publicly abjured his errors. And before long,
      others of his house will follow his example."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What mean you, sir?" demanded Jane, anxiously. "You do not surely allude
      to my husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Feckenham made no reply, but with a significant smile departed. The
      insinuation was not lost upon Jane. And now she more than ever lamented
      that she was not near her husband, to strengthen his wavering faith, and
      confirm his resolution. Well knowing that his character in a great measure
      resembled his father's, she feared that the inducement held out by his
      enemies might be too much for his resistance. Unable to communicate her
      fears to him&mdash;or to offer any of the counsel her heart suggested, she
      could only relieve her distresses by earnest supplications in his behalf.
      But even prayer did not on this occasion afford her the consolation it was
      wont to do. The Duke of Northumberland's recantation perpetually haunted
      her; and the thought that her husband might be made a similar example
      filled her with inexpressible dread..
    </p>
    <p>
      While suffering from these agonising reflections, she received another
      visit from Feckenham. The expression of his countenance, which was
      triumphing and sinister, alarmed her, and she almost felt unwilling,
      though at the same time anxious, to question him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After enjoying her suspense for a few minutes, he said, "Daughter, you
      blamed the Duke of Northumberland for being reconciled to our church.
      What, if I inform you that Lord Guilford Dudley has been likewise
      converted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should indeed be grieved to hear it," replied Jane, in a tone of
      anguish; "but I trust it is not so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is as I have said," answered Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven pardon him!" exclaimed Jane. "You bring me ill news, indeed. I had
      far rather you came to tell me the executioner was waiting for me&mdash;nay,
      that my husband was about to be led to the block&mdash;than this fatal
      intelligence. I thought our separation would be short. But now I find it
      will be eternal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are in error, daughter," rejoined Feckenham, sternly. "You will
      neither be separated from your husband in this world, nor the next, if you
      are equally conformable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to understand, then, that his apostacy, for I can give it no milder
      term, has been purchased by an offer of pardon?" demanded Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said not so, daughter," replied Feckenham; "but I now tell you that his
      hopes of grace rest with yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With me?" cried Jane, with a look of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With you, daughter," repeated the confessor. "Much as it rejoices our
      pious Queen to win over one soul like that of Lord Guilford Dudley to the
      true faith&mdash;gladly as she will receive his recantation, she will
      pledge herself to mercy only on one condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your conversion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A safe promise, for her clemency will never be exhibited," replied Jane.
      "Not even to purchase my husband's life would I consent. I would willingly
      die to bring him back to the paths from which he has strayed. But I will
      not surrender myself to Rome and her abominations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your firmness, in a good cause, daughter, would elicit my approbation,"
      replied Feckenham. "As it is, it only excites my compassion. I am deeply
      concerned to see one so richly gifted so miserably benighted&mdash;one so
      fair so foully spotted with heresy. I should esteem it a glorious victory
      over Satan to rescue your soul from perdition, and will spare no pains to
      do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is in vain, sir," replied Jane; "and if I have hitherto repressed my
      anger at these solicitations, it is because feeling firm in myself, I look
      upon them merely as an annoyance, to which it is my duty to submit with
      patience. But when I perceive the mischief they have done to others, I can
      no longer contain my indignation. Yours is a pernicious and idolatrous
      religion,&mdash;a religion founded on the traditions of men, not on the
      word of God&mdash;a religion detracting from the merits of our Saviour&mdash;substituting
      mummery for the simple offices of prayer,&mdash;and though I will not be
      uncharitable enough to assert that its sincere professors will not be
      saved,&mdash;yet I am satisfied, that no one to whom the true light of
      heaven has once been vouchsafed, can believe in it, or be saved by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you are thus obstinate, daughter," replied Feckenham, "let us
      dispute point by point, and dogma by dogma, of our creeds, and I think I
      can convince you of the error in which you rest. Do not fear wearying me.
      I cannot be better employed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, then, sir, if I reply, than I <i>can</i> be far better
      employed," returned Jane; "and, though I would not shrink from such a
      discussion&mdash;were it useful,&mdash;and do not fear its result, yet, as
      no good can arise from it, I must decline it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, daughter," rejoined Feckenham. "But I must own that your
      refusal to accept my challenge seems a tacit admission of the weakness of
      your cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put what construction you please upon it, sir,&mdash;so you leave me in
      peace," replied Jane. "I will fight the good fight when called upon to do
      so. But I will not waste the little time that remains to me in fruitless
      disputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I depart, however, daughter," rejoined Feckenham, "let me deliver
      your husband's message to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" inquired Jane, eagerly,&mdash;"and yet, I almost dread to
      ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He implored you not to be his executioner," answered Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>His</i> executioner!&mdash;my husband's executioner!&mdash;oh, no!&mdash;no!
      that I can never be!" cried Jane, bursting into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you <i>will</i> be, unless you consent," replied the priest, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beseech you, sir, urge me no further," rejoined Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would lay down my life for my husband a thousand times, but I cannot
      save him thus. Tell him that I will pray for him night and day,&mdash;and
      oh! tell him that his swerving from his faith has wounded me more severely
      than the axe will ever do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall tell him that I left you in the same obstinate state I found you&mdash;deaf
      to the voice of truth&mdash;inaccessible to natural affection, and
      besotted with heresy. Daughter, you love not your husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not love him!" echoed Jane, passionately. "But no,&mdash;you shall not
      shake my firmness. I thought to die calmly, and I looked forward to death
      as to a certain restoration to my husband. This hope is now at an end. It
      is you, sir, who are his true executioner. Not content with robbing him of
      his eternal happiness, you impute his destruction to me. Tell him I love
      him too well to grant his request&mdash;and if he loves me, and hopes to
      be reunited to me in the bonds of unceasing happiness, he will remain
      unshaken in his adherence to the Protestant faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you absolutely refuse compliance?" demanded Fecken-ham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely," replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your husband's blood be upon your head!" exclaimed the confessor, in a
      menacing voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      And without another word, he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the door of her chamber was locked, and Jane felt herself
      alone, she threw herself on her knees, and was about to pour out her heart
      in earnest supplication for her husband, but the shock had been too great
      for her, and she fainted. On reviving, she was scarcely able to move, and
      it was some time before she entirely regained her strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repairing to the palace, Feckenham detailed the interview to the queen,
      observing in conclusion, "I still do not despair of her conversion, and
      shall leave no means untried to accomplish it." The next day, he again
      visited Jane, but with no better success. He found her in great
      affliction, and she earnestly implored to be allowed to see her husband,
      if only for a few minutes, and in the presence of witnesses. The confessor
      replied that in her present frame of mind her request could not be
      granted. But that if she showed herself conformable she should no longer
      be separated from him, and he would answer for their ultimate pardon. "I
      have already acquainted you with my determination, sir," rejoined Jane,
      "and you will seek in vain to move me. The rack should not shake my
      constancy; neither shall the mental torture to which you subject me."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Feckenham reported the result of his mission to Gardiner, the bishop
      decided upon holding a religious conference with the captive, feeling
      confident that notwithstanding her boasted learning and zeal, he could
      easily overcome her in argument. To induce her to assent to the plan, it
      was agreed that a meeting should be allowed between her and her husband on
      the occasion. When the matter was announced to Jane, she readily expressed
      her acquiescence, and begged that it might not be delayed, as she had no
      preparation to make. "Take heed," she observed, in conclusion, "lest I win
      back from you the treasure you have gained."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall add to it a greater treasure&mdash;yourself, madam," replied the
      confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, she was summoned by an officer of the guard to
      attend the Bishop in the Beauchamp Tower. Taking up a volume of the Holy
      Scriptures lying on a table beside her, and wrapping herself in an ermined
      surcoat, she arose and followed the officer&mdash;quitting her chamber for
      the first time for nearly two months. On issuing into the open air, the
      effect was almost overpowering, and she could not repress her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bright, sunshiny morning, and everything looked so beautiful&mdash;so
      happy, that the contrast with her recent sufferings was almost too much
      for her. Bearing up resolutely against her feelings, in order forcibly to
      divert her attention she fixed her eyes upon the reverend walls of the
      White Tower, which she was at that moment passing. Near it she perceived
      the three gigantic warders, all of whom doffed their caps as she
      approached. Og coughed loudly, as if to clear his throat; Gog hastily
      brushed the moisture from his eyes with his sleeve; while Magog, who was
      the most tender-hearted of the three, fairly blubbered aloud. Xit, who
      formed one of the group, but who was the least affected, bade her be of
      good cheer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This encounter was so far of service to Jane, that it served to distract
      her thoughts, and she had in a great measure regained her composure, when
      another incident occurred, which had nearly upset her altogether. As she
      passed near the porch of Saint Peter's Chapel, she beheld Simon Renard
      emerge from it. And if she felt her blood chilled by the sight of her
      implacable foe, her alarm was not diminished on hearing him call to her
      guards to bring her within the chapel. At a loss to comprehend the meaning
      of this mysterious summons, Jane entered the sacred structure. Coldly
      saluting her, Renard informed her that her husband was within the chapel.
      Trembling at the intimation, Jane looked eagerly round. At first, she
      could discern nothing; but, guided by the ambassador's malignant glance,
      she perceived a figure kneeling in front of the altar. Instantly
      recognising her husband, with an exclamation of delight that made him
      spring to his feet, she rushed forward and threw herself into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first passionate emotion had subsided, Jane inquired how he came
      to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not know?" replied Lord Guilford. "Or have you been kept in
      ignorance of the terrible tragedy which has been recently enacted? Look
      there!" And he pointed downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane obeyed, and saw that she was standing upon a gravestone, on which was
      inscribed in newly-cut letters&mdash;
    </p>
    <h3>
      <i>JOHN DUDLEY, DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND.</i>
    </h3>
    <h3>
      <i>&mdash;DECAPITATED AUGUST 22, 1553</i>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Jane trembled and leaned upon her husband for support. "Here is the victim&mdash;there
      the executioner," said Lord Guilford, pointing from the grave to Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three months ago," said the Ambassador, who stood with folded arms at a
      little distance from them, "within this very chapel, I told the Duke of
      Northumberland he would occupy that grave. My words have been fulfilled.
      And I now tell you, Lord Guilford Dudley, and you Lady Jane, that unless
      you are reconciled with our holy Church, you will rest beside him."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he quitted the chapel, and the guards closing round the
      captives, they were compelled to follow. During their short walk, Jane
      passionately implored her husband not to yield to the persuasions of his
      enemies. He hung his head and returned no answer, and she inferred from
      his silence, that he was not disposed to yield to her solicitations. They
      were now close upon the Beauchamp Tower, when Dudley, pointing to a barred
      window in the upper story of one of its turrets, observed&mdash;"Within
      that room my father parsed the last few weeks of his existence."
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Ascending the spiral stone stairs of the tower, they passed beneath the
      arched doorway, and entered the principal chamber&mdash;now used&mdash;as
      has more than once been observed&mdash;as the mess-room of the garrison.
      Here they found Gardiner awaiting their arrival, he was seated on a high
      backed arm chair between Bonner and Feckenham, who occupied stools on
      either side of him, while behind him stood the friar who had attended the
      Duke of Northumberland on the scaffold. Across one of the deep and arched
      embrazures of the room looking towards the south, a thick curtain was
      drawn, and before it, at a small table covered with a crimson cloth, on
      which writing materials were placed, sat a secretary prepared to take down
      the heads of the disputation. On Jane's appearance, Gardiner and the other
      ecclesiastics arose and gravely saluted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are welcome, daughter," said the bishop. "You have come hither an
      unbeliever in our doctrines. I trust you will depart confirmed in the
      faith of Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am come to vanquish, not to yield, my lord," replied Jane, firmly. "And
      as I shall give you no quarter, so I expect none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," rejoined the bishop. "To you, my son," he continued,
      addressing Lord Guilford, "I can hold very different language. I can give
      you such welcome as the prodigal son received, and rejoice in your
      reconciliation with your heavenly father. And I sincerely trust that this
      noble lady, your consort, will not be a means of turning aside that mercy
      which her most gracious Majesty is desirous of extending towards you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said Jane, stepping between them, and steadfastly regarding the
      bishop, "if I am wrong and my husband is right, the Queen will do well not
      to punish the innocent with the guilty. And you, dear Dudley," she
      continued, taking his hand, and gazing at him with streaming eyes, "grant
      me one favour&mdash;the last I shall ever ask of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daughter!" observed Gardiner, severely, "I cannot permit this
      interference. I must interpose my authority to prevent your attempting to
      shake your husband's determination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I ask, my lord, is this," rejoined Jane, meekly; "that he will abide
      the issue of the disputation before he renounces his faith for ever. It is
      a request, which I am sure neither he, nor <i>you</i> will refuse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is granted, daughter," replied Gardiner; "the rather that I feel so
      certain of convincing you that I doubt not you will then as strongly urge
      his reconciliation as you now oppose it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would that not my husband alone, but that all Christendom could be
      auditors of our conference, my lord," replied Jane. "In this cause I am as
      strong, as in the late on which I was engaged I was weak. With this
      shield," she continued, raising the Bible which she carried beneath her
      arm, "I cannot sustain injury." Advancing towards the table at which the
      secretary was seated, she laid the sacred volume upon it. She then
      divested of her surcoat, and addressed a few words, in an under tone, to
      her husband, while the ecclesiastics conferred together. While this was
      passing, Lord Guilford's eye accidentally fell upon his father's
      inscription on the wall, and he called Jane's attention to it. She sighed
      as she looked, and remarked, "Do not let your name be stained like his."
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving Simon Renard gazing at them with malignant satisfaction, she
      then turned to Gardiner and said, "My lord, the presence of this person
      troubles me. I pray you, if he be not needful to our conference, that you
      will desire him to withdraw."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop acquiesced, and having signified his wishes to the ambassador,
      he feigned to depart. But halting beneath the arched entrance, he remained
      an unseen witness of the proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight pause ensued, during which Jane knelt beside the chair, and
      fervently besought heaven to grant her strength for the encounter. She
      then arose, and fixing her eye upon Gardiner, said in a firm tone, "I am
      ready, my lord, I pray you question me, and spare me not."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      No further intimation was necessary to the bishop, who immediately
      proceeded to interrogate her on the articles of her faith; and being a man
      of profound learning, well versed in all the subtleties of scholastic
      dispute, he sought in every way to confound and perplex her. In this he
      was likewise assisted by Bonner and Feckenham, both of whom were admirable
      theologians, and who proposed the most difficult questions to her. The
      conference lasted several hours, during which Jane sustained her part with
      admirable constancy&mdash;never losing a single point&mdash;but retorting
      upon her opponents questions, which they were unable to answer&mdash;displaying
      such a fund of erudition&mdash;such powers of argument&mdash;such close
      and clear reasoning&mdash;and such profound knowledge of the tenets of her
      own faith and of theirs, that they were completely baffled and astounded.
      To a long and eloquent address of Gardiner's she replied at equal length,
      and with even more eloquence and fervour, concluding with these emphatic
      words&mdash;"My lord, I have lived in the Protestant faith, and in that
      faith I will die. In these sad times, when the power of your church is in
      the ascendant, it is perhaps needful there should be martyrs in ours to
      prove our sincerity. Amongst these I shall glory to be numbered&mdash;happy
      in the thought that my firmness will be the means in after ages, of
      benefiting the Protestant church. On this rock," she continued, pointing
      to the Bible, which lay open before her&mdash;"my religion is built, and
      it will endure, when yours, which is erected on sandy foundations, shall
      be utterly swept away. In this sacred volume, I find every tenet of my
      creed, and I desire no other mediator between my Maker and myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she said this, her manner was so fervid, and her look so full of
      inspiration, that all her listeners were awe-stricken, and gazed at her in
      involuntary admiration. The secretary suspended his task to drink in her
      words; and even Simon Renard, who ensconced beneath the door-way, seemed
      no inapt representation of the spirit of evil, appeared confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief pause, Gardiner arose, saying, "the conference is ended,
      daughter. You are at liberty to depart. If I listen longer," he added, in
      an under tone to his companions, "I shall be convinced against my will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you acknowledge your defeat, my lord," said Jane, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acknowledge that it is in vain to make any impression on you," answered
      the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," cried her husband, advancing towards her, and throwing himself on
      his knees before her, "you have conquered, and I implore your forgiveness.
      I will never change a religion of which you are so bright an ornament."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is indeed a victory," replied Jane, raising him and clasping him to
      her bosom. "And now, my lord," she added to Gardiner, "conduct us to
      prison or the scaffold as soon as you please. Death has no further
      terrors."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a parting embrace, and an assurance from her husband, that he would
      now remain constant in his faith, Jane was removed by her guard to the
      Brick Tower, while Lord Guilford was immured in one of the cells adjoining
      the room in which the conference had taken place.

      XI.&mdash;HOW CUTHBERT CHOLMONDELEY REVISITED THE STONE KITCHEN; AND HOW
      HE WENT IN SEARCH OF CICELY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>uthbert
      Cholmondeley, who, it may be remembered, attended Lord Guilford Dudley,
      when he was brought from Sion House to the Tower, was imprisoned at the
      same time as that unfortunate nobleman, and lodged in the Nun's Bower&mdash;a
      place of confinement so named, and situated, as already mentioned, in the
      upper story of the Coal Harbour Tower. Here he was detained until after
      the Duke of Northumberland's execution, when, though he was not restored
      to liberty, he was allowed the range of the fortress. The first use he
      made of his partial freedom was to proceed to the Stone Kitchen, in the
      hope of meeting with Cicely; and his bitter disappointment may be
      conceived on finding that she was not there, nor was anything known of her
      by her foster-parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never since the ill-fated Queen Jane, whom they now call a usurper, took
      her into her service, have I set eyes upon her," said Dame Potentia, who
      was thrown into an agony of affliction, by the sight of Cholmondeley.
      "Hearing from old Gunnora Braose, that when her unfortunate mistress was
      brought back a captive to the Tower she had been left at Sion House, and
      thinking she would speedily return, I did not deem it necessary to send
      for her; but when a week had elapsed, and she did not make her appearance,
      I desired her father to go in search of her. Accordingly, he went to Sion
      House, and learnt that she had been fetched away, on the morning after
      Queen Jane's capture, by a man who stated he had come from us. This was
      all Peter could learn. Alas! Alas!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did not your suspicions alight on Nightgall?" asked Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, marry, did they," replied the pantler's wife; "but he averred he had
      never quitted the Tower. And as I had no means of proving it upon him, I
      could do nothing more than tax him with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He still retains his office of jailer, I suppose?" said Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a surety," answered Potentia; "and owing to Simon Renard, whom you may
      have heard, is her Majesty's right hand, he has become a person of greater
      authority than ever, and affects to look down upon his former friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He cannot look down upon me at all events," exclaimed a loud voice behind
      them. And turning at the sound, Cholmondeley beheld the bulky figure of
      Gog darkening the door-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cordial greeting passed between Cholmondeley and the giant, who in the
      same breath congratulated him upon his restoration to liberty, and
      condoled with him on the loss of his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the midst of grief we must perforce eat," observed the pantler, "and
      our worthy friends, the giants, as well as Xit, have often enlivened our
      board, and put care to flight. Perhaps you are not aware that Magog has
      been married since we last saw you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Magog married!" exclaimed Cholmondeley, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay. indeed!" rejoined Gog, "more persons than your worship have been
      astonished by it. And shall I let you into secret&mdash;if ever husband
      was henpecked, it is my unfortunate brother. Your worship complains of
      losing your mistress. Would to heaven he had had any such luck! And the
      worst of it is that before marriage she was accounted the most amiable of
      her sex."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, that's always the case," observed Peter Trusbut; "though I must do my
      dame the justice to say that she did not disguise her qualities during my
      courtship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not hear a word uttered in disparagement of Dame Potentia," cried
      Ribald, who at that moment entered the kitchen, "even by her husband. Ah!
      Master Cholmondeley I am right glad to see you. I heard of your release
      to-day. So, the pretty bird is flown you find&mdash;and whither none of us
      can tell, though I think I could give a guess at the fowler."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So could I," replied Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare say both our suspicions tend to the same mark," said Ribald&mdash;"but
      we must observe caution now&mdash;for the person I mean is protected by
      Simon Renard, and others in favour with the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is little better than an assassin," said Cholmondeley; "and has
      detained a wretched woman whom he has driven out of her senses by his
      cruelty a captive in the subterranean dungeons beneath the Devilin Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he proceeded to detail all he knew of the captive Alexia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very dreadful, no doubt," remarked Ribald, who had listened to
      the recital with great attention. "But as I said before, Nightgall is in
      favour with persons of the greatest influence, and he is more dangerous
      and vindictive than ever. What you do, you must do cautiously."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the party had been increased by the arrival of Og and Xit,
      both of whom, but especially the latter, appeared rejoiced to meet with
      the young esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Master Cholmondeley," said the elder giant, heaving a deep sigh.
      "Times have changed with us all since we last met. Jane is no longer
      Queen. The Duke of Northumberland is beheaded. Cicely is lost. And last
      and worst of all, Magog is married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have heard from Gog," replied Cholmondeley, "and I fear not very
      much to your satisfaction.1'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor his own either," replied Og, shrugging his shoulders. "However it
      can't be helped. He must make the best of a bad bargain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It <i>might</i> be helped though," observed Xit. "Magog seems to have
      lost all his spirit since he married. If I had to manage her, I'd soon let
      her see the difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, forsooth!" exclaimed Dame Potentia, contemptuously. "Do you imagine
      any woman would stand in awe-of you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And before the dwarf could elude her grasp, she seized him by the nape of
      the neck, and regardless of his cries, placed him upon the chimney-piece,
      amid a row of shining pewter plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you shall remain," she added, "till you beg pardon for your
      impertinence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit looked piteously around, but seeing no hand extended to reach him
      down, and being afraid to spring from so great a height, he entreated the
      dame's forgiveness in a humble tone; and she thereupon set him upon the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty person you are to manage a wife," said Dame Potentia, with a
      laugh, in which all, except the object of it, joined.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being Cholmondeley's intention to seek out a lodging at one of the
      warder's habitations, he consulted Peter Trusbut on the subject, who said,
      that if his wife was agreeable, he should be happy to accommodate him in
      his own dwelling. The matter being referred to Dame Potentia she at once
      assented, and assigned him Cicely's chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      On taking possession of the room, Cholmondeley sank upon a chair, and for
      some time indulged the most melancholy reflections, from which he was
      aroused by a tremendous roar of laughter, such as he knew could only be
      uttered by the gigantic brethren, proceeding from the adjoining apartment.
      Repairing thither, he found the whole party assembled round the table,
      which was, as usual, abundantly, or rather superabundantly, furnished.
      Amongst the guests were Magog and his wife, and the laughter he had heard
      was occasioned by a box administered by the latter to the ears of her
      spouse, because he had made some remark that sounded displeasing in her
      own. Magog bore the blow with the utmost philosophy, and applied himself
      for consolation to a huge pot of metheglin, which he held to his lips as
      long as a drop remained within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had good doings in Queen's Jane's reign," remarked Peter Trusbut,
      offering the young esquire a seat beside him, "but we have better in those
      of Queen Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, certainly, his assertion was fully borne out by the great joints of
      beef, the hams, the pasties, and pullets with which the table groaned, and
      with which the giants were making their accustomed havoc. In the midst
      stood what Peter Trusbut termed a royal pasty, and royal it was, if size
      could confer dignity. It contained two legs of mutton, the pantler assured
      his guests, besides a world of other savoury matters, enclosed in a wall
      of rye-crust, and had taken twenty-four hours to bake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twenty-four hours!" echoed Magog. "I will engage to consume it in the
      twentieth part of the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For that observation you shall not even taste it," said his arbitrary
      spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Debarred from the pasty, Magog made himself some amends by attacking a
      gammon of Bayonne bacon, enclosed in a paste, and though he found it
      excellent, he had the good sense to keep his opinion to himself. In this
      way, the supper passed off&mdash;Ribald jesting as usual, and devoting
      himself alternately to the two dames&mdash;Peter Trusbut carving the
      viands and assisting his guests&mdash;and the giants devouring all before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the close of the repast, Xit, who always desired to be an object
      of attention, determined to signalise himself by some feat. Brandishing
      his knife and fork, he therefore sprang upon the table, and striding up to
      the royal pasty, peeped over the side, which was rather higher than
      himself, to take a survey of the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus occupied, Dame Placida, who was sitting opposite to the
      pasty, caught him by the skirts of his doublet, and tossed him into the
      pie, while Peter Trusbut instantly covered it with the thick lid of crust,
      which had been removed when it was first opened. The laughter which
      followed this occurrence was not diminished, as the point of Xit's knife
      appeared through the wall of pastry&mdash;nor was it long before he
      contrived to cut a passage out.
    </p>
    <p>
      His re-appearance was hailed with a general shout of merriment. And Magog
      was by no means displeased at seeing him avenge himself by rushing towards
      his plump partner, and before she could prevent him, throw his arms round
      her, and imprint a sounding kiss upon her lips, while his greasy
      habiliments besmeared her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit would have suffered severely for this retaliation, if it had not been
      for the friendly interference of Ribald, who rescued him from the clutches
      of the offended dame, and contrived with a tact peculiar to himself not
      only to appease her anger, but to turn it into mirth. Order being once
      more restored, the dishes and plates were removed, and succeeded by
      flagons and pots of ale and wine. The conversation then began to turn upon
      a masque about to be given to the Queen by the Earl of Devonshire, at
      which they were all to assist, and arrangements were made as to the
      characters they should assume. Though this topic was interesting enough to
      the parties concerned, it was not so to Cholmondeley, who was about to
      retire to his own chamber to indulge his grief unobserved, when his
      departure was arrested by the sudden entrance of Lawrence Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the jailor's appearance, the merriment of the party instantly ceased,
      and all eyes were bent upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your business here, master Nightgall?" demanded Peter Trusbut, who was
      the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My business is with Master Cuthbert Cholmondeley," replied the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "State it then at once," replied the esquire, frowning. "It is to
      ascertain where you intend to lodge, that I may report it to the
      lieutenant," said Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall remain here," replied Cholmondeley, sternly&mdash;"in Cicely's
      chamber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here!" exclaimed Nightgall, starting, but instantly recovering himself,
      he turned to Peter Trusbut, and in a voice of forced composure, added&mdash;"You
      will be responsible then for him, Master Pantler, with your life and goods
      to the Queen's highness, which, if he escapes, will both be forfeited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" cried Trusbut, in dismay. "I&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;my husband understands all that," interposed Dame
      Potentia; "he will be answerable for him&mdash;and so will I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will understand still further," proceeded Nightgall, with a smile of
      triumph, "that he is not to stir forth except for one hour at mid-day, and
      then that his walks are to be restricted to the green."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Og observed in a whisper to Xit&mdash;"If I were
      possessed of that bunch of keys at Nightgall's girdle, I could soon find
      Cicely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said Xit. "Then you shall soon have them." And the next minute
      he disappeared under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a warrant for what you do, I suppose?" demanded Og, desirous of
      attracting the jailor's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Behold it," replied Nightgall, taking a parchment from his vest. He then
      deliberately seated himself, and producing an ink-horn and pen, wrote
      Peter Trusbut's name upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Pantler," he continued, delivering it to him, "I have addressed it
      to you. Once more I tell you, you will be responsible for the prisoner.
      And with this I take my leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so fast, villain," said Cholmondeley, seizing his arm with a firm
      grasp,&mdash;"where is Cicely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will never behold her more," replied Nightgall. "What have you done
      with the captive Alexia?" pursued the esquire, bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She likewise is beyond your reach," answered the jailor, moodily. And
      shaking off Cholmondeley's grasp, he rushed out of the chamber with such
      haste as nearly to upset Xit, who appeared to have placed himself
      purposely in his path.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurrence threw a gloom over the mirth of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation flagged, and even an additional supply of wine failed to
      raise the spirits of the guests. Just as they were separating, hasty steps
      were heard on the stairs, and Night-gall again presented himself. Rushing
      up to Cholmondeley, who was sitting apart wrapt in gloomy thought, he
      exclaimed in a voice of thunder&mdash;"My keys!&mdash;my keys!&mdash;you
      have stolen my keys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What keys?" demanded the esquire, starting to his feet. "Those of
      Alexia's dungeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Restore them instantly," cried Nightgall, furiously&mdash;"or I will
      instantly carry you back to the Nun's Bower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were they in my possession," replied Cholmondeley, "nothing should force
      them from me till I had searched your most secret hiding-places."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis therefore you stole them," cried Nightgall. "See where my girdle has
      been cut," he added, appealing to Peter Trusbut. "If they are not
      instantly restored, I will convey you all before the lieutenant, and you
      know how he will treat the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Terrified by this threat, the pantler entreated the esquire, if he really
      had the keys, to restore them. But Cholmondeley positively denied the
      charge, and after a long and fruitless search, all the party except Xit,
      who had disappeared, having declared their ignorance of what had become of
      them, Nightgall at last departed, in a state of the utmost rage and
      mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, the party broke up, and Cholmondeley retired to his own
      room. Though the pantler expressed no fear of his escaping, he did not
      neglect the precaution of locking the door. Throwing himself on a couch,
      the esquire, after a time, fell into a sort of doze, during which he was
      haunted by the image of Cicely, who appeared pale and suffering, and as if
      imploring his aid. So vivid was the impression, that he started up, and
      endeavoured to shake it off. In vain. He could not divest himself of the
      idea that he was at that moment subjected to the persecutions of
      Nightgall. Having endured this anguish for some hours, and the night being
      far advanced, he was about to address himself once more to repose, when he
      heard the lock turned, and glancing in the direction of the door,
      perceived it cautiously opened by Xit. The mannikin placed his finger to
      his lips in token of silence, and held up a huge bunch of keys, which
      Cholmondeley instantly conjectured were those lost by Nightgall. Xit then
      briefly explained how he had possessed himself of them, and offered them
      to Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love the fair Cicely," he said, "hate Nightgall, and entertain a high
      respect for your worship. I would gladly make you happy with your mistress
      if I can. You have now at least the means of searching for her, and heaven
      grant a favourable issue to the adventure. Follow me, and tread upon the
      points of your feet, for the pantler and his spouse occupy the next room."
    </p>
    <p>
      As they crossed the kitchen, they heard a sound proceeding from an
      adjoining room, which convinced them that neither Peter Trusbut nor Dame
      Potentia were on the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They don't snore <i>quite</i> so loud as my friends the giants,"
      whispered Xit; "but they have tolerably good lungs.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Having, at Xit's suggestion, armed himself with a torch and materials to
      light it, and girded on a sword which he found reared against the wall,
      the esquire followed his dwarfish companion down a winding stone
      staircase, and speedily issued from the postern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was profoundly dark, and they were therefore unobserved by the
      sentinels on the summit of the Byward Tower, and on the western ramparts.
      Without delaying a moment, Cholmondeley hurried towards the Devilin Tower.
      Xit accompanied him, and after some little search they found the secret
      door, and by a singular chance Cholmondeley, on the first application,
      discovered the right key. He then bade farewell to the friendly dwarf, who
      declined attending him further, and entering the passage, and locking the
      door withinside, struck a light and set fire to the torch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely knowing whither to shape his course, and fully aware of the
      extent of the dungeons he should have to explore, Cholmondeley resolved to
      leave no cell unvisited, until he discovered the object of his search. For
      some time, he proceeded along a narrow arched passage, which brought him
      to a stone staircase, and descending it, his further progress was stopped
      by an iron door. Unlocking it, he entered another passage, on the right of
      which was a range of low cells, all of which he examined, but they were
      untenanted, except one, in which he found a man whom he recognized as one
      of the Duke of Northumberland's followers. He did not, however, dare to
      liberate him, but with a few words of commiseration passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning off on the left, he proceeded for some distance, until being
      convinced by the hollow sound of the floor that there were vaults beneath,
      he held his torch downwards, and presently discovered an iron ring in one
      of the stones. Raising it, he beheld a flight of steps, and descending
      them, found himself in a lower passage about two feet wide, and apparently
      of considerable length. Hastily tracking it, he gradually descended until
      he came to a level, where both the floor and ceiling were damp and humid.
      His torch now began to burn feebly, and threw a ghastly light upon the
      slimy walls and dripping roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus pursuing his way, a long and fearful shriek broke upon
      his ear, and thinking it might proceed from the captive Alexia, he
      hastened forward as quickly as the slippery path would allow him. It was
      evident, from the increasing humidity of the atmosphere, that he was
      approaching the river. As he advanced the cries grew louder, and he became
      aware, from the noise around, that legions of rats were fleeing before
      him. These loathsome animals were in such numbers, that Cholmondeley,
      half-fearing an attack from them, drew his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      After proceeding about fifty yards, the passage he was traversing
      terminated in a low wide vault, in the centre of which was a deep pit.
      From the bottom of this abyss the cries resounded, and hurrying to its
      edge, he held down the torch, and discovered, at the depth of some twenty
      feet, a miserable half-naked object up to his knees in water, and
      defending himself from hundreds of rats that were swarming around him.
      While he was considering how he could accomplish the poor wretch's
      deliverance, who continued his shrieks more loudly than ever, asserting
      that the rats were devouring him, Cholmondeley perceived a ladder in a
      corner of the vault, and lowering it into the pit, the sides of which were
      perpendicular and flagged, instantly descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been horrified at the vociferations of the prisoner, he was now
      perfectly appalled by the ghastly spectacle he presented. The unfortunate
      person had not exaggerated his danger when he said that the rats were
      about to devour him. His arms, body, and face were torn and bleeding, and
      as Cholmondeley approached he beheld numbers of his assailants spring from
      him and swim off. More dead than alive, the sufferer expressed his thanks,
      and taking him in his arms, Cholmondeley carried him up the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had gained the edge of the pit, the esquire, who had been
      struck with the man's voice, examined his features by the light of the
      torch, and was shocked to find that he was one of the attendants of the
      Duke of Northumberland, with whom he was well acquainted. Addressing him
      by his name, the man instantly knew him, and informed him that he had been
      ordered into confinement by the council, and having given some offence to
      Nightgall, had been tortured and placed in this horrible pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been here two days and nights," he said, "as far as I can guess,
      without food or light, and should soon have perished, had it not been for
      your aid; and, though I do not fear death,&mdash;yet to die by inches&mdash;a
      prey to those horrible animals&mdash;was dreadful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me support you," returned Cholmondeley, taking his arm, "and while
      you have strength left, convey you to a more wholesome part of the
      dungeon, where you will be free from these frightful assailants, till I
      can procure you further assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor prisoner gratefully accepted his offer, and lending him all the
      assistance in his power, Cholmondeley slowly retraced his course. Having
      reached the flight of stone steps, leading to the trap-door, the esquire
      dragged his companion up them, and finding it in vain to carry him
      further, and fearing he should be disappointed in the main object of his
      search, he looked around for a cell in which he could place him for a
      short time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving a door standing ajar on the left, he pushed it open, and,
      entering a small cell, found the floor covered with straw, and, what was
      still more satisfactory to him, discovered a loaf on a shelf, and a large
      jug of water. Placing the prisoner on the straw, he spread the provisions
      before him, and having seen him partake of them, promised to return as
      soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bestow no further thought on me," said the man. "I shall die content
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley then departed, and proceeding along the passage he had just
      traversed, came to a wide arched opening on the left, which he entered,
      and pursuing the path before him, after many turnings, arrived at another
      low circular vault, about nineteen feet in diameter, which, from the
      peculiar form of its groined arches, he supposed (and correctly) must be
      situated beneath Devereux Tower.

    <p>
      Of a style of architecture of earlier date than the Beauchamp Tower, the
      Devilin, or, as it is now termed, the Devereux Tower, from the
      circumstance of Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, the favourite of Queen
      Elizabeth, having been confined within it in 1601, has undergone less
      alteration than most of the other fortifications, and except in the
      modernising of the windows, retains much of its original character. In the
      dungeon into which Cholmondeley had penetrated, several curious
      spear-heads of great antiquity, and a gigantic thigh-bone, have been
      recently found.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the further end of the vault Cholmondeley discovered a short flight of
      steps, and mounting them unlocked a door, which admitted him to another
      narrow winding stone staircase. Ascending it, he presently came to a door
      on the left, shaped like the arched entrance in which it was placed. It
      was of strong oak, studded with nails, and secured by a couple of bolts.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Drawing back the fastenings, he unsheathed his sword, and pushing aside
      the door with the blade, raised his torch, and beheld a spectacle that
      Idled him with horror. At one side of the cell, which was about six feet
      long and three wide, and contrived in the thickness of the wall, upon a
      stone seat rested the dead body of a woman, reduced almost to a skeleton.
      The face was turned from the door, but rushing forward he instantly
      recognised its rigid features. On the wall close to where she lay, and
      evidently carved by her own hand, was traced her name&mdash;ALEXIA.

      XII.&mdash;-HOW EDWARD UNDERHILL, THE "HOT-GOSPELLER," ATTEMPTED TO
      ASSASSINATE QUEEN MARY; AND HOW SHE WAS PRESERVED BY SIR HENRY BEDINGFELD.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>mong those who
      viewed Mary's accession to the throne with the greatest dissatisfaction,
      was the Hot-Gospeller. Foreseeing the danger with which the Protestant
      church was menaced, he regarded the change of sovereigns as one of the
      most direful calamities that could have befallen his country. The open
      expression of these sentiments more than once brought him into trouble,
      and he was for some time placed in durance. On his liberation, he observed
      more caution; and though his opinions were by no means altered, but rather
      strengthened, he no longer gave utterance to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his imprisonment, he had pondered deeply upon the critical state of
      his religion; and having come to the conclusion that there was no means
      but one of averting the threatened storm, he determined to resort to that
      desperate expedient. Underhill's temporal interests had been as much
      affected as his spiritual, by the new government. He was dismissed from
      the post he had hitherto held of gentleman-pensioner; and this
      circumstance, though he was, perhaps, scarcely conscious of it,
      contributed in no slight degree to heighten his animosity against the
      queen. Ever brooding upon the atrocious action he was about to commit, he
      succeeded in persuading himself, by that pernicious process of reasoning
      by which religious enthusiasts so often delude themselves into the
      commission of crime, that it was not only justifiable, but meritorious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though no longer a prisoner, or employed in any office, the Hot-Gospeller
      still continued to linger within the Tower, judging it the fittest place
      for the execution of his purpose. He took up his abode in a small stone
      cell, once tenanted by a recluse, and situated at the back of Saint
      Peter's chapel, on the Green; devoting his days to prayer, and his nights
      to wandering, like a ghost, about the gloomiest and least-frequented parts
      of the fortress. He was often challenged by the sentinels,&mdash;often
      stopped, and conveyed to the guard-room by the patrol; but in time they
      became accustomed to him, and he was allowed to pursue his ramblings
      unmolested. By most persons he was considered deranged, and his wasted
      figure&mdash;for he almost denied himself the necessaries of life,
      confining his daily meal to a crust of bread, and a draught of water,&mdash;together
      with his miserable attire, confirmed the supposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon one occasion, Mary herself, who was making the rounds of the
      fortress, happened to notice him, and ordered him to be brought before
      her. A blaze of fierce delight passed over the enthusiast's face when the
      mandate was conveyed to him. But his countenance fell the next moment, on
      recollecting that he was unarmed. Bitterly reproaching himself for his
      want of caution, he searched his clothes. He had not even a knife about
      him. He then besought the halberdiers who came for him to lend him a cloak
      and a sword, or even a partizan, to make a decent appearance before the
      queen. But laughing at the request, they struck him with the poles of
      their weapons, and commanded him to follow them without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brought into the royal presence, he with difficulty controlled himself.
      And nothing but the conviction that such a step would effectually defeat
      his design, prevented him from pouring forth the most violent threats
      against the queen. As it was, he loudly lamented her adherence to the
      faith of Rome, entreating her to abjure it, and embrace the new and
      wholesome doctrines,&mdash;a course, which he predicted, would ensure her
      a long and prosperous reign, whereas, a continuance in her present
      idolatrous creed would plunge her kingdom in discord, endanger her crown,
      and, perhaps, end in her own destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding him as a half-crazed, but harmless enthusiast, Mary paid little
      attention to his address, which was sufficiently wild and incoherent to
      warrant the conclusion that his intellects were disordered. Pitying his
      miserable appearance, and inquiring into his mode of life, she ordered him
      better apparel, and directed that he should be lodged within the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underhill would have refused her bounty, but, at a gesture from Mary, he
      was removed from her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interview troubled him exceedingly. He could not reconcile the
      queen's destruction to his conscience so easily as he had heretofore done.
      Despite all his reasoning to the contrary, her generosity affected him
      powerfully. He could not divest himself of the idea that she might yet be
      converted; and persuading himself that the glorious task was reserved for
      him, he resolved to make the attempt, before resorting to a darker mode of
      redress. Managing to throw himself, one day, in her way, as she was
      proceeding along the grand gallery, he immediately commenced a furious
      exhortation. But his discourse was speedily interrupted by the queen, who
      ordered her attendants to remove him into the court yard, and cudgel him
      soundly; directing that any repetition of the offence should be followed
      by severer chastisement. This sentence was immediately carried into
      effect. The Hot-Gospeller bore it without a murmur. But he internally
      resolved to defer no longer his meditated design.
    </p>
    <p>
      His next consideration was how to execute it. He could not effect his
      purpose by poison; and any attempt at open violence would, in all
      probability, (as the queen was constantly guarded,) be attended by
      failure. He therefore determined, as the surest means, to have recourse to
      fire-arms. And, being an unerring marksman, he felt certain of success in
      this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having secretly procured an arquebuss and ammunition, he now only awaited
      a favourable moment for the enterprise. This soon occurred. It being
      rumoured one night in the Tower, that the queen was about to proceed by
      water to Whitehall on the following morning, he determined to station
      himself at some point on the line of road, whence he could take deliberate
      aim at her. On inquiring further, he ascertained that the royal train
      would cross the drawbridge leading from the south of the Byward Tower to
      the wharf, and embark at the stairs. Being personally known to several
      officers of the guard, he thought he should have no difficulty in
      obtaining admittance to Saint Thomas's Tower, which, while it commanded
      the drawbridge, and was within shot, was yet sufficiently distant not to
      excite suspicion. Accordingly, at an early hour, on the next day, he
      repaired thither, wrapped in a cloak, beneath which he carried the
      implement of his treasonable intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he anticipated, he readily procured admission, and, under pretence of
      viewing the passage of the royal train, was allowed a place at a narrow
      loophole in the upper story of one of the western turrets. Most of the
      guard being required on the summit of the fortification, Underhill was
      left alone in the small chamber. Loud shouts, and the discharge of
      artillery from the ramparts of the fortress, as well as from the roofs of
      the different towers, proclaimed that Mary had set forth. A few embers
      were burning on the hearth in the chamber occupied by the enthusiast. With
      these he lighted his tow-match, and offering up a prayer for the success
      of his project, held himself in readiness for its execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unconscious of the impending danger, Mary took her way towards the By-ward
      Tower. She was attended by a numerous retinue of nobles and gentlemen.
      Near her walked one of her councillors, Sir Henry Bedingfeld, in whom she
      placed the utmost trust, and whose attachment to her had been often
      approved in the reigns of her father and brother, as well as during the
      late usurpation of Lady Jane Grey. Sir Henry was a grave-looking,
      dignified personage, somewhat stricken in years. He was attired in a robe
      of black velvet, of the fashion of Henry the Eighth's time, and his beard
      was trimmed in the same bygone mode. The venerable knight walked
      bare-headed, and carried a long staff, tipped with gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Mary had reached the gateway opening upon the scene of her
      intended assassination. The greater part of her train had already passed
      over the drawbridge, and the deafening shouts of the beholders, as well as
      the renewed discharges of artillery, told that the queen was preparing to
      follow. This latter circumstance created a difficulty, which Underhill had
      not foreseen. Confined by the ramparts and the external walls of the moat,
      the smoke from the ordnance completely obscured the view of the
      drawbridge. Just, however, as Mary set foot upon it, and Underhill had
      abandoned the attempt in despair, a gust of wind suddenly dispersed the
      vapour. Conceiving this a special interposition of Providence in his
      favour, who had thus placed his royal victim in his hands, the
      Hot-Gospeller applied the match to the arquebuss, and the discharge
      instantly followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen's life, however, was miraculously preserved. Sir Henry
      Bedingfeld, who was walking a few paces behind her, happening to cast his
      eye in the direction of Traitor's Tower, perceived the barrel of an
      arquebuss thrust from a loop-hole in one of the turrets, and pointed
      towards her. Struck with the idea that some injury might be intended her,
      he sprung forward, and interposing his own person between the queen and
      the discharge, drew her forcibly backwards. The movement saved her. The
      ball passed through the knight's mantle, but without harming him further
      than ruffling the skin of his shoulder; proving by the course it took,
      that, but for his presence of mind, its fatal effect must have been
      certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was the work of an instant. Undismayed by the occurrence, Mary,
      who inherited all her father's intrepidity, looked calmly round, and
      pressing Bedingfeld's arm in grateful acknowledgment of the service he had
      rendered her, issued her commands that the assassin should be secured,
      strictly examined, and, if need be, questioned on the rack. She then
      proceeded to the place of embarkation as deliberately as if nothing had
      happened. Pausing before she entered the barge, she thus addressed her
      preserver:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Henry Bedingfeld, you have ever been my loyal servant. You were the
      first, during the late usurpation, to draw the sword in my defence&mdash;the
      first to raise troops for me&mdash;to join me at Framlingham&mdash;to
      proclaim me at Norwich. But you have thrown all these services into the
      shade by your last act of devotion. I owe my life to you. What can I do to
      evince my gratitude?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have already done more than enough in thus acknowledging it, gracious
      madam," replied Sir Henry; "nor can I claim any merit for the action.
      Placed in my situation, I am assured there is not one of your subjects,
      except the miscreant who assailed you, who would not have acted in the
      same manner. I have done nothing, and deserve nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, sir," returned Mary. "Most of my subjects, I believe, share your
      loyalty. But this does not lessen your desert. I should be wanting in all
      gratitude were I to let the service you have rendered me pass unrequited.
      And since you refuse to tell me how I can best reward you, I must take
      upon myself to judge for you. The custody of our person and of our
      fortress shall be entrusted to your care. Neither can be confided to
      worthier hands. Sir John Gage shall receive another appointment.
      Henceforth, you are Lieutenant of the Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      This gracious act was followed by the acclamations of the bystanders; and
      the air resounded with cries of "God save Queen Mary!&mdash;a Bedingfeld!&mdash;a
      Bedingfeld!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty has laid an onerous duty upon me, but I will endeavour to
      discharge it to your satisfaction," replied Sir Henry, bending the knee,
      and pressing her hand devotedly to his lips. And amid the increased
      acclamations of the multitude, Mary entered her barge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Underhill, meanwhile, whose atrocious purpose had been thus
      providentially defeated, on perceiving that his royal victim had escaped,
      uttered an ejaculation of rage and disappointment, flung down the
      arquebuss, and folding his arms upon his bosom, awaited the result.
      Fortunately, an officer accompanied the soldiers who seized him, or they
      would have hewn him in pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretched man made no attempt to fly, or to defend himself, but when
      the soldiers rushed into the room, cried, "Go no further. I am he you
      seek."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know it, accursed villain," rejoined the foremost of their number,
      brandishing a sword over his head. "You have slain the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would I had!" rejoined Underhill. "But it is not the truth. The Lord was
      not willing I should be the instrument of his vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear the blasphemer!" roared another soldier, dealing him a blow in the
      mouth with the pummel of his dagger, that made the blood gush from his
      lips. "He boasts of the villany he has committed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my arm had not been stayed, I had delivered the land from idolatry and
      oppression," returned Underhill. "A season of terrible persecution is at
      hand, when you will lament as much as I do, that my design has been
      frustrated. The blood of the righteous would have been spared; the fagots
      at the stake un-lighted; the groans of the martyrs unheard. But it is the
      Lord's will that this should be. Blessed be the name of the Lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence, hell-dog!" vociferated a third soldier, placing the point of his
      halbert at his breast. "Host think Heaven would approve the foul deed thou
      meditatedst? Silence! I say, or I will drive my pike to thy heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will <i>not</i> be silent," rejoined Underhill, firmly. "So long as
      breath is left me, I will denounce the idolatrous queen by whom this
      unhappy land is governed, and pray that the crown may be removed from her
      head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather than thou shalt do so in my hearing, I will pluck out thy
      traitorous tongue by the roots," returned the soldier who had last spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace," interposed the officer. "Secure him, but harm him not. He may
      have confederates. It is important that all concerned in this atrocious
      attempt should be discovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no accomplice," replied Underhill. "My own heart dictated what my
      hand essayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May that hand perish in everlasting fire for the deed!" rejoined the
      officer. "But if there be power in torture to make you confess who set you
      on, it shall not be left untried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already spoken the truth," replied the enthusiast; "and the
      sharpest engine ever devised by ruthless man shall not make me gainsay it,
      or accuse the innocent. I would not have shared the glory of the action
      with any one. And since it has failed, my life alone shall pay the
      penalty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gag him," cried the officer. "If I listen longer, I shall be tempted to
      anticipate the course of justice, and I would not one pang should be
      spared him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The command was obeyed. On searching him, they found a small powder-flask,
      a few bullets, notched, to make the wound they inflicted more dangerous, a
      clasp-knife, and a bible, in the first leaf of which was written a prayer
      for the deliverance and restoration of Queen Jane,&mdash;a circumstance
      afterwards extremely prejudicial to that unfortunate lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Underhill had been detained for some hours in the chamber where he
      was seized, an order arrived to carry him before the council. Brought
      before them, he answered all their interrogations firmly, confessed his
      design, related how he had planned it, and denied as before, with the
      strongest asseverations, that he had any accomplice. When questioned as to
      the prayer for Lady Jane Grey, whom he treasonably designated "Queen
      Jane," he answered that he should ever regard her as the rightful
      sovereign, and should pray with his latest breath for her restoration to
      the throne&mdash;a reply, which awakened a suspicion that some conspiracy
      was in agitation in Jane's favour. Nothing further, however, could be
      elicited, and he was ordered to be put to the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delivered by the guard to Lawrence Nightgall and his assistants, he was
      conveyed to the torture-chamber. The sight of the dreadful instruments
      there collected, though enough to appal the stoutest breast, appeared to
      have no terror for him. Scrutinizing the various engines with a look of
      curiosity, he remarked that none of them seemed to have been recently
      used; and added, that they would soon be more frequently employed. He had
      not been there many minutes, when Mauger, the headsman, Wolfytt, the sworn
      tormentor, and Sorrocold the chirurgeon, arrived, and preparations were
      made for administering the torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rack has already been described as a large oaken frame, raised about
      three feet from the ground, having a roller at each end, moved by a lever.
      Stripped, and placed on his back on the ground, the prisoner was attached
      by strong cords to the rollers. Stationing themselves at either extremity
      of the frame, Mauger and Wolfytt each seized a lever, while Nightgall took
      up his position at the small table opposite, to propose the
      interrogations, and write down the answers. The chirurgeon remained near
      the prisoner, and placed his hand upon his wrist. Those preparations made,
      Nightgall demanded, in a stern tone, whether the prisoner would confess
      who had instigated him to the crime he had committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said I have no accomplices," replied Underhill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall made a sign to the assistants, and the rollers were turned with
      a creaking sound, extending the prisoners limbs in opposite directions,
      and giving him exquisite pain. But he did not even groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of a few moments, Nightgall said, "Edward Underhill, I
      again ask you who were your accomplices?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer being returned, the jailor waved his hand, and the levers were
      again turned. The sharpness of the torture forced an involuntary cry from
      the prisoner. But beyond this expression of suffering, he continued
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interrogation was a third time repeated; and after some effort on the
      part of the assistants, the levers were again turned. Nightgall and the
      chirurgcon both watched this part of the application with some curiosity.
      The strain upon the limbs was almost intolerable. The joints started from
      their sockets, and the sinews were drawn out to their utmost capability of
      tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the wretched man had endured this for a few minutes, Sorrocold
      informed Nightgall, in a low tone, that nature was failing. The cords were
      then gradually relaxed, and he was unbound. His temples being bathed with
      vinegar, he soon afterwards revived.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was only recovered from one torture to undergo another. The next
      step taken by his tormentors was to place him in a suit of irons, called
      the Scavenger's Daughter&mdash;a hideous engine devised by Sir William
      Skevington, lieutenant of the Tower, in Henry the Eighth's reign, and
      afterwards corrupted into the name above mentioned. By this horrible
      machine, which was shaped like a hoop, his limbs were compressed so
      closely together that he resembled a ball; and being conveyed to an
      adjoining dungeon, he was left in this state without light or food for
      further examination.

      XIII.&mdash;HOW MAGOG NEARLY LOST HIS SUPPER; HOW HIS BEARD WAS BURNT; HOW
      XIT WAS PLACED IN A BASKET; AND HOW HE WAS KICKED UPON THE RAMPARTS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ongratulations,
      rejoicings, and public thanksgivings followed the queen's preservation
      from the hand of the assassin. Courtenay, who had long planned a masque to
      be exhibited for her amusement within the Tower, thought this a fitting
      occasion to produce it. And the utmost expedition being used, on the day
      but one after Underhill's attempt, all was in readiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great mystery having been observed in the preparations for the pageant,
      that it might come upon the spectators as a surprise, none, except those
      actually concerned in it, knew what was intended to be represented. Even
      the actors, themselves, were kept in darkness concerning it, and it was
      only on the night before, when their dresses were given them, that they
      had any precise notion of the characters they were to assume. A sort of
      rehearsal then took place in one of the lower chambers of the palace; at
      which the Earl of Devonshire assisted in person, and instructed them in
      their parts. A few trials soon made all perfect, and when the rehearsal
      was over, Courtenay felt satisfied that the pageant would go off with
      tolerable eclat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As may be supposed, the three gigantic warders and their diminutive
      follower were among the mummers. Indeed, the principal parts wore assigned
      them; and on no previous occasion had Xit's characteristic coxcombry been
      more strongly called forth than during the rehearsal. No consequential
      actor of modern times could give himself more airs. Perceiving he was
      indispensable, he would only do exactly what pleased him, and, when
      reprimanded for his impertinence, refused to perform at all, and was about
      to walk off with an air of offended dignity. A few conciliatory words,
      however, from the Earl of Devonshire induced him to return; and when all
      was arranged to his satisfaction, he began to exhibit a fun and humour
      that bid fair to outshine all his competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rehearsal over, a substantial repast was provided by the earl for his
      troop. And here, as usual, the giants acquitted themselves to admiration.
      Unfortunately, however, for Magog, his spouse was present, and his dull
      apprehension of his part at the rehearsal, having excited her displeasure,
      she now visited it upon his devoted head. Whenever he helped himself to a
      piece of meat, or a capon, she snatched it from his plate, and transferred
      it to those of his brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was nearly over, and the hen-pecked giant, who as yet had tasted
      nothing, was casting wistful glances at the fast-vanishing dishes, when
      Dame Placida arose, and saying she was greatly fatigued, expressed her
      determination to return home immediately. In vain Magog remonstrated. She
      was firm, and her hapless spouse was arising with a most rueful
      countenance to accompany her, when Ribald very obligingly offered to take
      his place and escort her. Dame Placida appeared nothing loth, and Magog,
      having eagerly embraced the proposal, the pair departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now brother," said Gog, "you can do as you please. Make up for lost
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubt it not," replied Magog, "and by way of commencing, I will trouble
      you for that sirloin of beef. Send me the dish and the carving-knife, I
      pray you, for with this puny bit of steel I can make no progress at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      His request was immediately complied with, and it was pleasant to behold
      with what inconceivable rapidity slice after slice disappeared. In a brief
      space, a few bare bones were all that remained of the once-lordly joint.
      Magog's brethren watched his progress with truly fraternal interest. Their
      own appetites being satisfied, they had full leisure to minister to his
      wants; and most sedulously did they attend to them. A brisket of veal,
      steeped in verjuice, supplied the place of the sirloin, and a hare-pie, in
      due season, that of the veal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magog acknowledged these attentions with grateful murmurings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was too busy to speak. When the hare-pie, which was of a somewhat
      savoury character, was entirely consumed, he paused for a moment, and
      pointed significantly to a large measure of wine at some little distance
      from him. Og immediately stretched out his arm, and handed it to him.
      Nodding to his brother, the married giant drained its contents at a
      draught, and then applied himself with new ardour to the various dishes
      with which his plate was successively laden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would your wife say, if she could see you now?" observed Peter
      Trusbut, who sat opposite to him, and witnessed his proceedings with
      singular satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mention her," rejoined Magog, bolting a couple of cheesecakes which
      he had crammed, at the same time, into his capacious mouth; "don't mention
      her, or you will take away my appetite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear of that," laughed the pantler; "but what say you to a glass of
      distilled waters? It will be a good wind-up to your meal, and aid
      digestion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," rejoined the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pantler then handed him a stone bottle, holding perhaps a quart, and
      knowing his propensities, thought it needful to caution him as to the
      strength of the liquid. Disregarding the hint, Magog emptied the greater
      part of the spirit into a flagon, and tossed it off, as if it had been
      water. Peter Trusbut held up his hands in amazement, and expected to see
      the giant drop senseless under the table. But no such event followed. The
      only consequence of the potent draught being that it brought the water
      into his eyes, and made him gasp a little to recover his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you feel after it, brother?" inquired Og, slapping him on the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So valiant," hiccupped Magog, "that I think when I get home, I shall
      assert my proper position as a lord of the creation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Act up to that resolution, Master Magog," observed the pantler, laughing,
      "and I shall not think my liquor thrown away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If such be its effect," said Xit, who; it has before been remarked, had
      an unconquerable tendency to imitate, and, if possible, exceed the
      extravagancies of his companions, "I will e'en try a drop of it myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      And before he could be prevented, the mannikin applied the stone bottle to
      his lips, and drained it to the last drop. If Magog's brain was
      sufficiently stolid to resist the effect of the fiery liquid, Xit's was
      not. Intoxication speedily displayed itself in the additional brilliancy
      of his keen sparkling little orbs, and in all his gestures. At first, his
      antics created much diversion, and he was allowed to indulge them freely;
      but before long he became so outrageous and mischievous, that it was found
      necessary to restrain him. Springing upon the table, he cut the most
      extraordinary capers among the dishes, breaking several of them, upsetting
      the flagons and pots of wine, tweaking the noses of the male guests,
      kissing the females, and committing a hundred other monkey tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On being called to order, he snapped his fingers in the face of the
      reprover, and conceiving himself especially affronted by Gog, he threw a
      goblet at his head. Luckily, the missile was caught before it reached its
      mark. He next seized a torch, and perceiving that Magog had fallen asleep,
      set fire to his beard, to arouse him. Starting to his feet, the giant
      clapped his hand to his chin&mdash;too late however, to save a particle of
      his hirsute honours. His rage was terrific. Roaring like a wild bull, he
      vowed he would be the death of the offender; and would have kept his word,
      if it had not been for his brethren, who, seizing each an arm, restrained
      him by main strength, and forced him into his seat, where, after a few
      minutes, his anger gave way to laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was mainly attributable to an accident that befel Xit in his hurry to
      escape. Not being particular where he set his feet, the dwarf plumped into
      an open plum tart, the syrup of which was so thick and glutinous that it
      detained him as effectually as birdlime. In his terror, he dragged the
      dish after him to a considerable distance, and his grimaces were so
      irresistibly ludicrous that they convulsed the beholders with laughter. No
      one attempted to assist him, and it was only by the loss of both shoes
      that he could extricate himself from his unpleasant situation. Peter
      Trusbut then seized him, and thrusting him into a basket, fastened down
      the lid to prevent further mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurrence served as the signal for separation. Og and Gog took their
      way to the By-ward Tower, the latter carrying the basket containing Xit
      under his arm, while Magog, bemoaning the loss of his beard, and afraid of
      presenting himself to his wife under such untoward circumstances,
      accompanied them as far as the gateway of the Bloody Tower. Here he paused
      to say good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would I could anticipate a good night, myself!" he groaned "But I can
      neither eat, drink, nor sleep in comfort now. Ah! brothers, if I had but
      listened to your advice! But repentance comes too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does&mdash;it does," replied Gog; "But let us hope your dame will
      amend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That she never will," screamed Xit from the basket. "What a lucky escape
      <i>I</i> had&mdash;ha! ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace! thou stinging gadfly," roared Magog. "Am I ever to be tormented by
      thee!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Xit, who imagined himself secure, only laughed the louder, he grew
      at last so enraged, that snatching the basket from Og, he placed it on the
      ground, and gave it such a kick, that it flew to the top of the ramparts
      beyond Traitor's Tower, where it was picked up by a sentinel, and the
      dwarf taken out more dead than alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching his habitation&mdash;which was the same Dame Placida had
      formerly occupied during her state of widowhood, at the right of the road
      leading from the Bloody Tower to the Green,&mdash;Magog found she had not
      retired to rest as he expected, but was engaged in conversation with
      Ribald, who had been prevailed upon to remain for a few minutes to taste
      the ale for which she was so much, and so justly, celebrated. One cup had
      led to another, and the jovial warder seemed 'in no hurry to depart. The
      giant was delighted to see him, and, forgetting his misfortune, was about
      to shake him heartily by the hand, when his wife screamed out&mdash;"Why
      Magog, what is the matter with your chin? You have lost your beard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Humbly deprecating her resentment, the giant endeavoured to explain. But
      as nothing would satisfy her, he was fain to leave her with Ribald, and
      betake himself to his couch, where he speedily fell asleep, and forgot his
      troubles.

    <h2>
      XIV.&mdash;OF THE MASQUE GIVEN BY COURTENAY IN HONOUR OF QUEEN MARY; AND
      HOW XIT WAS SWALLOWED BY A SEA-MONSTER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>uring the early
      part of the next day, the majority of the inmates of the Tower were on the
      tiptoe of expectation for the coming pageant, which was fixed to take
      place in the evening in the large court lying eastward of that wing of the
      palace, denominated the Queen's Lodgings. The great hall, used on the
      previous night for the rehearsal, was allotted as a dressing-room to those
      engaged in the performance, and thither they repaired a few hours before
      the entertainment commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the day declined, multitudes flocked to the court, and stationed
      themselves within the barriers, which had been erected to keep off the
      crowd. In addition to these defences, a warder was stationed at every ten
      paces, and a large band of halberdiers was likewise in attendance to
      maintain order. Banners were suspended from the battlements of the four
      towers flanking the corners of the court,&mdash;namely, the Salt Tower,
      the Lanthorn Tower, the Wardrobe Tower, and the Broad Arrow Tower. The
      summits of these fortifications were covered with spectators, as were the
      eastern ramparts, and the White Tower. Such windows of the palace as
      overlooked the scene, were likewise thronged.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the southern extremity of the court, stretching from the Lanthorn Tower
      to the Salt Tower, stood a terrace, raised a few feet above the level of
      the inclosure, and protected by a low-arched balustrade of stone. This was
      set apart for the Queen, and beneath a mulberry-tree, amid the branches of
      which a canopy of crimson velvet was disposed, her chair was placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six o'clock, when every inch of standing-room was occupied, and
      expectation raised to its highest pitch, a door in the palace leading to
      the terrace was thrown open, and the Queen issued from it. Stunning
      vociferations welcomed her, and these were followed, or rather
      accompanied, by a prolonged flourish of trumpets. It was a moment of great
      excitement, and many a heart beat high at the joyous sounds. Every eye was
      directed towards Mary, who bowing repeatedly in acknowledgment of her
      enthusiastic reception, was saluted with&mdash;"God save your highness!
      Confusion to your enemies! Death to all traitors!" and other exclamations
      referring to her late providential deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen was attired in a rich gown of raised cloth of gold. A partlet,
      decorated with precious stones, surrounded her throat, and her stomacher
      literally blazed with diamonds. Upon her head she wore a caul of gold, and
      over it, at the back, a round cap, embroidered with orient pearls. In
      front, she wore a cornet of black velvet, likewise embroidered with
      pearls. A couple of beautiful Italian greyhounds, confined by a silken
      leash, accompanied her. She was in excellent spirits, and, whether excited
      by the promised spectacle, or by some secret cause, appeared unusually
      animated. Many of the beholders, dazzled by her gorgeous attire, and
      struck by her sprightly air, thought her positively beautiful. Smilingly
      acknowledging the greetings of her subjects, she gave her hand to the Earl
      of Devonshire, and was conducted by him to the seat beneath the
      mulberry-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were followed by a numerous train of dames and nobles, foremost among
      whom came Sir Henry Bedingfeld,&mdash;who as lieutenant of the Tower,
      claimed the right of standing behind the royal chair. Next to the knight
      stood the Princess Elizabeth, who viewed with the bitterest jealousy the
      devoted attention paid by Courtenay to her sister; and, next to the
      princess, stood Jane the Fool. Simon Renard also was among the crowd. But
      he kept aloof, resolved not to show himself, unless occasion required it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the Queen was seated, another flourish of trumpets was blown,
      and from the great gates at the further end of the court issued a crowd of
      persons clothed in the skins of wild animals, dragging an immense machine,
      painted to resemble a rocky island. On reaching the centre of the
      inclosure, the topmost rock burst open, and discovered a beautiful female
      seated upon a throne, with a crown on her head, and a sceptre in her hand.
      While the spectators expressed their admiration of her beauty by loud
      plaudits, another rock opened, and discovered a fiendish-looking figure,
      armed with a strangely-formed musket, which he levelled at the mimic
      sovereign. A cry of horror pervaded the assemblage, but at that moment
      another rock burst asunder, and a fairy arose, who placed a silver shield
      between the Queen and the assassin; while a gauze drapery, wafted from
      beneath, enveloped them in its folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0046" id="linkimage-0046"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/0269.jpg" alt="0269 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0269.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At the appearance of the fairy, the musket fell from the assassin's grasp.
      Uttering a loud cry, a troop of demons issued from below, and seizing him
      with their talons bore him out of eight. The benignant fairy then waved
      her sword; the gauzy drapery dropped to her feet; and four other female
      figures arose, representing Peace, Plenty, Justice, and Clemency. These
      figures ranged themselves round the Queen, and the fairy addressed her in
      a speech, telling her that these were her attributes;&mdash;that she had
      already won her people's hearts, and ended by promising her a long and
      prosperous reign. Each word, that applied to Mary, was followed by a cheer
      from the bystanders, and when it was ended, the applauses were deafening.
      The mimic queen then arose, and taking off her crown, tendered it to the
      real sovereign. The four attributes likewise extended their arms towards
      her, and told her they belonged to her. And while the group was in this
      position, the machine was borne away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fresh flourishes of trumpets succeeded; and several lively airs were
      played by bands of minstrels stationed at different points of the
      court-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild and tumultuous din was now heard; and the gates being again thrown
      open, forth rushed a legion of the most grotesque and fantastic figures
      ever beheld. Some were habited as huge, open-jawed sea-monsters; others as
      dragons, gorgons, and hydras; others, as satyrs and harpies; others, as
      gnomes and salamanders. Some had large hideous masks, making them look all
      head,&mdash;some monstrous wings,&mdash;some long coiled tails, like
      serpents many were mounted on hobby-horses,&mdash;and all whose garbs
      would permit them, were armed with staves, flails, or other indescribable
      weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this multitudinous and confused assemblage had nearly filled the
      inclosure, loud roarings were heard, and from the gateway marched Gog and
      Magog, arrayed like their gigantic namesakes of Guildhall. A long
      artificial beard, of a blue tint, supplied the loss which Magog's singed
      chin had sustained. His head was bound with a wreath of laurel leaves.
      Gog's helmet precisely resembled that worn by his namesake, and he carried
      a curiously-formed shield, charged with the device of a black eagle, like
      that with which the wooden statue is furnished. Magog was armed with a
      long staff, to which a pudding-net, stuffed with wool, was attached; while
      Gog bore a long lathen spear. The appearance of the giants was hailed with
      a general roar of delight. But the laughter and applauses were increased
      by what followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more opened to their widest extent, the great gates admitted what, at
      first, appeared to be a moving fortification. From its sides projected two
      enormous arms, each sustaining a formidable club. At the summit stood a
      smaller turret, within which, encircled by a wreath of roses and other
      flowers, decorated with silken pennoncels, sat Xit, his pigmy person
      clothed in tight silk fleshings. Glittering wings fluttered on his
      shoulders, and he was armed with the weapons of the Paphian God. The
      tower, which, with its decorations, was more than twenty feet high, was
      composed of basket-work, covered with canvass, painted to resemble a round
      embattled structure. It was tenanted by Og, who moved about in it with the
      greatest case. A loophole in front enabled him to see what was going
      forward, and he marched slowly towards the centre of the inclosure. An
      edging of loose canvass, painted like a rocky foundation, concealed his
      feet. The effect of this moving fortress was highly diverting, and
      elicited shouts of laughter and applause from the beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That device," observed Courtenay to the queen, "represents a tower of
      strength&mdash;or rather, I should say, the Tower of London. It is about
      to be attacked by the rabble rout of rebellion, and, I trust, will be able
      to make good its defence against them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so," replied Mary, smiling. "I should be grieved to think that my
      good Tower yielded to such assailants. But who is that I perceive? Surely,
      it is Cupid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love is at present an inhabitant of the Tower," replied Courtenay, with a
      passionate look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising his eyes, the next moment, he perceived Elizabeth behind Sir Henry
      Bedingfeld. She turned from him with a look of reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      A seasonable interruption to his thoughts was offered by the tumultuous
      cry arising from the mummers. Gog and Magog having placed themselves on
      either side of the Tower as its defenders, the assault commenced. The
      object of the assailants was to overthrow the fortress. With this view,
      they advanced against it from all quarters, thrusting one another forward,
      and hurling their weapons against it. This furious attack was repelled by
      the two giants, who drove them back as fast as they advanced, hurling some
      head over heels, trampling others under foot, and exhibiting extraordinary
      feats of strength and activity. The Tower, itself, was not behind-hand in
      resistance. Its two arms moved about like the sails of a windmill, dealing
      tremendous blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conflict afforded the greatest amusement to the beholders; but while
      the fortress and its defenders maintained their ground against all the
      assailants, there was one person who began to find his position somewhat
      uncomfortable. This was Xit. So long as Og contented himself with keeping
      off his enemies, the dwarf was delighted with his elevated situation, and
      looked round with a smile of delight. But when the giant, animated by the
      sport, began to attack in his turn, the fabric in which he was encased
      swayed to and fro so violently, that Xit expected every moment to be
      precipitated to the ground. In vain he attempted to communicate his fears
      to Og. The giant was unconscious of his danger, and the din and confusion
      around them was so great, that neither Gog nor Magog could hear his
      outcries. As a last resource, he tried to creep into the turret, but this
      he found impracticable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The god of love appears in a perilous position, my lord," observed the
      queen, joining in the laughter of the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does, indeed," replied Courtenay; "and though the Tower may defend
      itself, I fear its chief treasure will be lost in the struggle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak the truth, my lord," remarked the deep voice of Simon lienard,
      from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Courtenay intended any reply to this observation of his mortal foe, it
      was prevented by an incident which at that moment occurred. Combining
      their forces, the rabble rout of dragons, gorgons, imps, and demons had
      made a desperate assault upon the Tower. Og whirled around his clubs with
      increased rapidity, and dozens were prostrated by their sweep. Gog and
      Magog likewise plied their weapons vigorously, and the assailants were
      driven back completely discomfited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, unluckily, at this moment, Og made a rush forward to complete his
      conquest, and in so doing pitched Xit out of the turret. Falling
      head-foremost into the yawning jaws of an enormous goggle-eyed
      sea-monster, whose mouth seemed purposely opened to receive him, and being
      moved by springs, immediately closed, the dwarf entirely disappeared. A
      scream of delight arose from the spectators, who looked upon the
      occurrence as part of the pageant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen laughed heartily at Xit's mischance, and even Courtenay, though
      discomposed by the accident, could not help joining in the universal
      merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might take it as an evil omen," he remarked in an under tone to Mary,
      "that love should be destroyed by your majesty's enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See! he re-appears," cried the queen, calling the earl's attention to the
      monster, whose jaws opened and discovered the dwarf. "He has sustained no
      injury."
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit's disaster, meanwhile, had occasioned a sudden suspension of
      hostilities among the combatants. All the mummers set up a shout of
      laughter, and the echoing of sound produced by their masks was almost
      unearthly. Gog and Magog, grinning from ear to ear, now approached the
      dwarf, and offered to restore him to his turret. But he positively refused
      to stir, and commanded the monster, in whose jaws he was seated, to carry
      him to the queen. After a little parley, the order was obeyed; and the
      huge pasteboard monster, which was guided within-side by a couple of men,
      wheeled round, and dragged its scaly length towards the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived opposite the royal seat, the mimic Cupid sprang out of the
      monster's jaws, and fluttering his gauzy wings (which were a little the
      worse for his recent descent) to give himself the appearance of flying,
      ran nimbly up the side of the terrace, and vaulted upon the balustrade in
      front of her majesty. He had still possession of his bow and arrows, and
      poising himself with considerable grace on the point of his left foot,
      fitted a silver shaft to the string, and aimed it at the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness is again threatened," observed Sir Henry Bedingfeld,
      advancing and receiving the arrow, which, winged with but little force,
      dropped harmlessly from his robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are ever faithful, Sir Henry," observed Mary, to the knight, whose
      zeal in this instance occasioned a smile among the attendants; "but we
      have little fear from the darts of Cupid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit, meanwhile, had fitted another arrow, and drawing it with greater
      force, struck Courtenay on the breast. Not content with this, the
      mischievous urchin let fly a third shaft at the Princess Elizabeth, who
      had advanced somewhat nearer the queen, and the arrow chancing to stick to
      some of the ornaments on her stomacher, appeared to have actually pierced
      her bosom. Elizabeth coloured deeply as she plucked the dart from her
      side, and threw it angrily to the ground. A cloud gathered on the queen's
      brow, and Courtenay was visibly disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit, however, either unconscious of the trouble he had occasioned, or
      utterly heedless of it, took a fourth arrow from his quiver, and affecting
      to sharpen its point upon the stone balustrade, shot it against Jane the
      Fool. This last shaft likewise hit its mark, though Jane endeavoured to
      ward it off with her marotte; and Xit Completed the absurdity of the scene
      by fluttering towards her, and seizing her hand, pressed it to his lips,&mdash;a
      piece of gallantry for which he was rewarded by a sound cuff on the ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, mistress," cried Xit, "that is scarcely fair. Love and Folly were
      well matched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Love mate with Folly, he must expect to be thus treated," replied
      Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, then, I will bestow my favours on the wisest woman I can find,"
      replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There thou wilt fail again," cried Jane; "for every wise woman will shun
      thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A truce to thy rejoinders, sweetheart," returned Xit. "Thy wit is as keen
      as my arrows, and as sure to hit the mark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wit resembles thy godship's arrows in one particular only," retorted
      Jane. "It strikes deepest where it is most carelessly aimed. But, hie
      away! Thou wilt find Love no match for Folly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I perceive," replied Xit, "and shall therefore proceed to Beauty. I
      must have been blinder than poets feign, to have come near thee at all. In
      my pursuit of Folly, I have forgot the real business of Love. But thus it
      is ever with me and my minions!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, he fluttered towards the queen, and prostrating himself before
      her, said&mdash;"Your majesty will not banish Love from your court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly not," replied Mary; "or if we did banish thee, thou wouldst be
      sure to find some secret entrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty is in the right," replied the mimic deity, "I should. And
      disdain not this caution from Cupid. As long as you keep my two
      companions, Jealousy and Malice, at a distance, Love will appear in his
      own rosy hues. But the moment you admit them, he will change his colours,
      and become a tormentor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if thou distributest thy shafts at random, so that lovers dote on
      more than one object, how am I to exclude Jealousy?" asked the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By cultivating self-esteem," replied Cupid. "The heart I have wounded for
      your highness can never feel disloyalty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true, thou imp," observed Courtenay; "and for that speech, I
      forgive thee the mischief thou hast done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so thou assurest me against infidelity?" said Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness may be as inconstant as you please," replied Cupid, "since
      the dart I aimed at you has been turned aside by Sir Henry Bedingfeld. But
      rest easy. He who loves you can love no other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am well satisfied," replied Mary, with a gratified look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And since I have thy permission to love whom I please, I shall avail
      myself largely of it, and give all my heart to my subjects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not <i>all</i> your heart, my gracious mistress," said Courtenay, in a
      tender whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, Xit, watching his opportunity, drew an arrow from his
      quiver, and touched the queen with it near the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have hit your majesty at last, as well as the Earl of Devonshire," he
      cried gleefully. "Shall I summon my brother Hymen to your assistance? He
      is among the crowd below."
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-suppressed smile among the royal attendants followed this daring
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That knave's audacity encourages me to hope, gracious madam," whispered
      Courtenay, "that this moment may be the proudest&mdash;the happiest of my
      life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this&mdash;at least not now, my lord," replied Mary, whose
      notions of decorum were somewhat scandalised at this public declaration.
      "Dismiss this imp. He draws too many eyes upon us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a set of verses to recite to your majesty," interposed Xit, whose
      quick ears caught the remark, and who was in no hurry to leave the royal
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not now," rejoined Mary, rising. "Fear nothing, thou merry urchin. We
      will take care Love meets its desert. We thank you, my lord," she added,
      turning to Courtenay, "for the pleasant pastime you have afforded us."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the queen arose, loud and reiterated shouts resounded from the
      spectators, in which all the mummers joined. Amid these acclamations she
      returned to the palace. Courtenay again tendered her his hand, and the
      slight pressure which he hazarded was sensibly returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she was about to enter the window, Mary turned round to bow for
      the last time to the assemblage, when there arose a universal cry&mdash;"Long
      live Queen Mary!&mdash;Long live the Earl of Devonshire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary smiled. Her bosom palpitated with pleasure, and she observed to her
      lover&mdash;"You are the people's favourite, my lord. I should not deserve
      to be their queen if I did not share in their affection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I then hope?" asked the Earl, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may," replied Mary, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brilliant vision which these words raised before Courtenay's eyes, was
      dispersed by a look which he at that moment received from Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The festivities in the court did not terminate with the departure of the
      royal train. Xit was replaced in the turret, whence he aimed his darts at
      the prettiest damsels he could perceive, creating infinite merriment among
      the crowd. An immense ring was then formed by all the mummers, who danced
      round the three giants, the minstrels accompanying the measure with
      appropriate strains. Nothing more grotesque can be imagined than the
      figures of Gog and Magog, as engaged in the dance, in their uncouth garbs.
      As to Og, he flourished his clubs, and twirled himself round with great
      rapidity in the opposite direction to the round of dancers, until at last,
      becoming giddy, he lost his balance, and fell with a tremendous crash,
      upsetting Xit for the second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever destined to accidents, the dwarf, from his diminutive stature, seldom
      sustained any injury, and upon this occasion, though a good deal
      terrified, he escaped unhurt. Og was speedily uncased, and, glad to be set
      at liberty, joined the ring of dancers, and footed it with as much glee as
      the merriest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the evening advanced, fire-works were discharged, and a daring
      rope-dancer, called Peter the Dutchman, ascended the cupola of the
      south-east turret of the White Tower, and got upon the vane, where he
      lighted a couple of torches. After standing for some time, now upon one
      foot&mdash;now on the other, he kindled a firework placed in a sort of
      helmet on his head, and descended amid a shower of sparks by a rope, one
      end of which was fastened in the court where the masquers were assembled.
      A substantial supper, of which the mummers and their friends partook,
      concluded the diversions of the evening, and all departed well satisfied
      with their entertainment.

    <h2>
      XV.&mdash;BY WHOSE INSTRUMENTALITY QUEEN MARY BECAME CONVINCED OF
      COURTENAY'S INCONSTANCY; AND HOW SHE AFFIANCED HERSELF TO PHILIP OF SPAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the
      festivities above described occurred without the palace, within, all was
      confusion and alarm. The look, which Elizabeth had given Courtenay, sank
      into his very soul. All his future greatness appeared valueless in his
      eyes, and his only desire was to break off the alliance with Mary, and
      reinstate himself in the affections of her sister. For the queen, it is
      almost needless to say, he felt no real love. But he was passionately
      enamoured of Elizabeth, whose charms had completely captivated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she could consistently do so, after her return to the palace,
      the princess retired to her own apartments, and though her departure
      afforded some relief to the earl, he still continued in a state of great
      perturbation. Noticing his altered manner, the queen inquired the cause
      with great solicitude. Courtenay answered her evasively. And putting her
      own construction upon it, she said in a tone of encouragement&mdash;"It
      was a strange remark made by the little urchin who enacted Cupid. Was he
      tutored in his speech?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not by me, gracious madam," replied Courtenay, distractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the knave hath a ready wit," returned the queen. "He has put
      thoughts into my head which I cannot banish thence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" exclaimed the earl. "I trust his boldness has not offended you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I look so?" rejoined Mary, smiling. "If I do, my countenance belies my
      feelings. No, Courtenay, I have been thinking that no woman can govern a
      great kingdom, like mine, unaided. She must have some one, to whom she can
      ever apply for guidance and protection,&mdash;some one to whom she can
      open her whole heart,&mdash;to whom she can look for counsel, consolation,
      love. In whom could she find all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In no one but a husband, gracious madam," replied Courtenay, who felt he
      could no longer affect to misunderstand her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, my lord," she replied playfully. "Can you not assist our
      choice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I dared,"&mdash;said Courtenay, who felt he was standing upon the
      verge of a precipice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" exclaimed Mary. "A queen must ever play the wooer. It is part of
      her prerogative. Our choice is already made&mdash;so we need not consult
      you on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I not ask whom your majesty has so far distinguished?" demanded the
      earl, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall learn anon, my lord," replied the queen. "We choose to keep you
      a short time in suspense, for here comes Simon Renard, and we do not
      intend to admit him to our confidence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That man is ever in my path," muttered the earl, returning the ambassador
      s stern glance with one equally menacing. "I am half reconciled to this
      hateful alliance by the thought of the mortification it will inflict upon
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      It would almost seem from Renard's looks, that he could read what was
      passing in the other's breast; for his brow grew each instant more
      lowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must quit your majesty for a moment," observed Courtenay, "to see to
      the masquers. Besides, my presence might be a restraint to your
      councillor. He shall not want an opportunity to utter his calumnies behind
      my back."
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard smiled bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, my lord," said the queen, giving him her hand to kiss. "When
      you return, you shall have your answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the last time his lips shall touch that hand," muttered Renard, as
      the earl departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On quitting the royal presence, Courtenay wandered in a state of the
      utmost disquietude to the terrace. He gazed vacantly at the masquers, and
      tried to divert his thoughts with their sports; but in vain. He could not
      free himself from the idea of Elizabeth. He had now reached the utmost
      height of his ambition. He was all but affianced to the queen, and he
      doubted not that a few hours&mdash;perhaps moments&mdash;would decide his
      fate. His bosom was torn with conflicting emotions. On one side stood
      power, with all its temptations&mdash;on the other passion, fierce,
      irrepressible passion. The struggle was almost intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      After debating with himself for some time, he determined to seek one last
      interview with Elizabeth, before he finally committed himself to the
      queen, vainly imagining it would calm his agitation. But, like most men
      under the influence of desperate emotion, he acted from impulse, rather
      than reflection. The resolution was no sooner formed, than acted upon.
      Learning that the Princess was in her chamber, he proceeded thither, and
      found her alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth was seated in a small room, partially hung with arras, and over
      the chair she occupied, were placed the portraits of her sire, Henry the
      Eighth, and two of his wives, Anne Boleyn and Catharine of Arragon.
      Greatly surprised by the earl's visit, she immediately arose, and in an
      authoritative tone commanded him to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is this?" she cried. "Are you not content with what you have already
      done, but must add insult to perfidy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me, Elizabeth," said Courtenay, advancing towards her, and throwing
      himself on his knee. "I am come to implore your forgiveness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have my compassion, my lord," rejoined Elizabeth; "but you shall not
      have my forgiveness. You have deeply deceived me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have deceived myself," replied Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A paltry prevarication, and unworthy of you," observed the Princess,
      scornfully. "But I have endured this long enough. Arise, and leave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will <i>not</i> leave you, Elizabeth," said Courtenay, "till I have
      explained the real motives of my conduct, and the real state of my
      feelings, which, when I have done, I am persuaded you will not judge me as
      harshly, as you do now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not desire to hear them," replied tho Princess. "But since you are
      determined to speak, be brief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "During my captivity in this fortress," began Courtenay, "when I scarcely
      hoped for release, and when I was an utter stranger, except from
      description, to the beauties of your sex, I had certain vague and
      visionary notions of female loveliness, which I have never since found
      realized except in yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth uttered an exclamation of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not interrupt me," proceeded Courtenay. "All I wish to show is, that
      long before I had seen you, my heart was predisposed to love you. On my
      release from imprisonment, it was made evident in many ways, that the
      Queen, your sister, regarded me with favourable eyes. Dazzled by the
      distinction&mdash;as who would not be?&mdash;I fancied I returned her
      passion. But I knew not then what love was&mdash;nor was it till I was
      bound in this thraldom that I became acquainted with its pangs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This you have said before, my lord," rejoined Elizabeth, struggling
      against her emotion. "And if you had not, it is too late to say it now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pardon, dearest Elizabeth," rejoined Courtenay, "for such you will
      ever be to me. I know I do not deserve your forgiveness. But I know, also,
      that I shall not the less on that account obtain it. Hear the truth from
      me, and judge me as you think proper. Since I knew that I had gained an
      interest in your eyes, I never could love your sister. Her throne had no
      longer any temptation for me&mdash;her attachment inspired me with
      disgust. You were, and still <i>are</i>, the sole possessor of my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still are! my lord," exclaimed Elizabeth, indignantly. "And you are about
      to wed the Queen. Say no more, or <i>my</i> pity for you will be changed
      into contempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my fate," replied the earl. "Oh! if you knew what the struggle has
      cost me, to sacrifice love at the shrine of ambition, you would indeed
      pity me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said Elizabeth, proudly, "if you have no respect for me, at
      least have some for yourself, and cease these unworthy lamentations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me you no longer love me&mdash;tell me you despise&mdash;hate me&mdash;anything
      to reconcile myself to my present lot," cried Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I to say I no longer loved you, I should belie my heart," rejoined
      Elizabeth; "for, unfortunately for my peace of mind, I have formed a
      passion which I cannot conquer. But were I also to say that your abject
      conduct does not inspire me with contempt&mdash;with scorn for you, I
      should speak falsely. Hear me, in my turn, my lord. To-morrow, I shall
      solicit permission from the Queen to retire from the court altogether, and
      I shall not return till my feelings towards yourself are wholly changed."
      "Say not so," cried Courtenay. "I will forego all the brilliant
      expectations held out to me by Mary. I cannot endure to part with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have gone too far to retreat, my lord," said Elizabeth. "You are
      affianced to my sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," replied Courtenay, "and I never will be. When I came hither, it
      was to implore your forgiveness, and to take leave of you for ever. But I
      find that wholly impossible. Let us fly from this fortress, and find
      either in a foreign land, or in some obscure corner of this kingdom, a
      happiness, which a crown could not confer."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he pronounced these words with all the ardour of genuine passion, he
      pressed her hand to his lips. Elizabeth did not withdraw it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Save me from this great crime," he cried&mdash;"save me from wedding one
      whom I have never loved&mdash;save me from an union, which my soul
      abhors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sincere?" asked Elizabeth, much moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my soul I am," replied Courtenay fervently. "Will you fly with me&mdash;this
      night&mdash;this hour,&mdash;now?"
    </p>

      "I will answer that question," cried a voice, which struck them both as if
      a thunderbolt had fallen at their feet. "I will answer that question,"
      cried Mary, forcibly throwing aside the arras and gazing at them with eyes
      that literally seemed to flash fire,&mdash;"she will <i>not.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had I not heard this with my own ears," she continued in a terrible tone,
      addressing her faithless lover, who still remained in a kneeling posture,
      regarding her with a look of mingled shame and defiance&mdash;"had I not
      heard this with my own ears, and seen it with my own eyes, I could not
      have believed it! Perfidious villain! you have deceived us both. . But you
      shall feel what it is to incur the resentment of a queen&mdash;and that
      queen the daughter of Henry the Eighth. Come in, sir," she added to some
      one behind the arras, and Simon Renard immediately stepped forth. "As I
      owe the discovery of the Earl of Devonshire's perfidy to you, the least I
      can do is to let you witness his disgrace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not attempt to defend myself, gracious madam," said Courtenay,
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defend yourself!" echoed the Queen, bitterly. "Not a word of your
      conversation to the Princess has escaped my ears. I was there&mdash;behind
      that curtain&mdash;almost as soon as you entered her chamber. I was
      acquainted with your treachery by this gentleman. I disbelieved him. But I
      soon found he spoke the truth. A masked staircase enabled me to approach
      you unobserved. I have heard all&mdash;all, traitor, all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To play the eaves-dropper was worthy of Simon Renard," returned
      Courtenay, with a look of deadly hatred at the ambassador, "but scarcely,
      I think, befitting the Queen of England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where the Queen of England has unworthy persons to deal with, she must
      resort to unworthy means to detect them," returned Mary. "I am deeply
      indebted to M. Renard for his service&mdash;more deeply than I can
      express. An hour more, and it had been too late. Had I affianced myself to
      you, I should have considered the engagement binding. As it is, I can
      unscrupulously break it. I am greatly beholden to you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am truly rejoiced to be the instrument of preventing your majesty from
      entering into this degrading alliance," said Renard.&mdash;"Had it taken
      place, you would have unceasingly repented it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you, minion," continued the Queen, turning to Elizabeth, who had
      looked silently on, "I have more pity than anger. You have been equally
      his dupe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not desire your highness's pity," rejoined the Princess, haughtily.
      "Your own case is more deserving of compassion than mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! God's death! derided!" cried the Queen, stamping her foot with
      indignation. "Summon the guard, M. Renard. I will place them both in
      confinement. Why am I not obeyed?" she continued, seeing the ambassador
      hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do nothing at this moment, I implore you, gracious madam." said Renard,
      in a low voice. "Disgrace were better than imprisonment. You punish the
      Earl sufficiently in casting him off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obey me, sir," vociferated Mary, furiously, "or I will fetch the guard
      myself. An outraged woman may tamely submit to her wrongs&mdash;an
      outraged Queen can revenge them. Heaven be thanked! I have the power to do
      so, as I have the will. Down on your knees, Edward Courtenay, whom I have
      made Earl of Devonshire, and <i>would</i> have made King of England&mdash;on
      your knees, I say. Now, my lord, your sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is here," replied the Earl, presenting it to her, "and I entreat your
      majesty to sheathe it in my bosom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His crime does not amount to high treason," whispered Renard, "nor can
      your highness do more than disgrace him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The guard! the guard, sir!" cried Mary, authoritatively. "Our father,
      Henry the Eighth, whose lineaments frown upon us from that wall, had not
      authority for all he did. He was an absolute king, and we are absolute
      queen. Again, I say, the guard! and bid Sir Henry Bedingfeld attend us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty shall be obeyed," replied Renard, departing. "Do with me
      what you please, gracious madam," said Courtenay, as soon as they were
      alone. "My life is at your disposal. But, I beseech you, do not visit my
      faults upon the Princess Elizabeth. If your majesty tracked me hither, you
      must be well aware that my presence was as displeasing to her as it could
      be to yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not be sheltered under this plea," replied Elizabeth, whose anger
      was roused by her sister's imperious conduct. "That the interview was
      unsought on my part, your highness well knows. But that I lent a willing
      ear to the Earl of Devonshire's suit is equally true. And if your highness
      rejects him, I see nothing to prevent my accepting him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This to my face!" cried Mary, in extremity of indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And wherefore not?" returned Elizabeth, maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anger me no further," cried Mary, "or by my father's soul! I will not
      answer for your head." Her manner was so authoritative, and her looks so
      terrible, that even Elizabeth was awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again," interposed Courtenay, humbly, "let me, who am the sole cause of
      your majesty's most just displeasure, bear the weight of it. The Princess
      Elizabeth, I repeat, is not to blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the best judge in my own cause, my lord," replied the Queen. "I will
      not hear a word more."
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep silence then ensued, which was broken by the entrance of the
      Lieutenant of the Tower and the guard. Renard brought up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Henry Bedingfeld," said Mary, "I commit the Princess Elizabeth and
      the Earl of Devonshire to your custody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can scarcely credit my senses, gracious Madam," replied Bedingfeld,
      gazing at the offenders with much concern, "and would fain persuade myself
      it is only a part of the pastime I have so recently witnessed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no pastime, Sir Henry," replied the Queen, sternly. "I little
      thought, when I entrusted you with the government of this fortress, how
      soon, and how importantly, you would have to exercise your office. Let the
      prisoners be placed in close confinement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the first time in my life," replied the old knight, "that I have
      hesitated to obey your majesty. And if I do so now, I beseech you to
      impute it to the right motive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, sir!" cried the Queen fiercely. "Do you desire to make me regret
      that I have removed Sir John Gage? <i>He</i> would not have hesitated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For your own sake, gracious madam," said Sir Henry, falling on his knees
      before her, "I beseech you pause. I have been a faithful servant of your
      high and renowned father. Henry the Eighth&mdash;of your illustrious
      mother, Catherine of Arragon, who would almost seem,&mdash;from their
      pictures on that wall,&mdash;to be present now. In <i>their</i> names, I
      beseech you pause. I am well aware your feelings have been greatly
      outraged. But they may prompt you to do that which your calmer judgment
      may deplore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remonstrance is in vain," rejoined the Queen. "I am inexorable. The
      Princess Elizabeth may remain a close prisoner in her own apartments. The
      Earl of Devonshire must be removed elsewhere. You will be answerable for
      their safe custody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," replied Bedingfeld, rising; "but I would that I had never lived
      to see this day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, he commanded his attendants to remove Courtenay, and when the
      order was obeyed, he lingered for a moment at the door, in the hope that
      the Queen would relent. But, as she continued immoveable, he departed with
      a sorrowful heart, and conveyed the Earl to his own lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay gone, Elizabeth's proud heart gave way, and she burst into a
      hood of tears. As Mary saw this, a feeling of compassion crossed her,
      which Renard perceiving, touched her sleeve, and drew her away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It were better to leave her now," he observed. Yielding to his advice,
      Mary was about to quit the room, when Elizabeth arose and threw herself at
      her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare him!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She thinks only of her lover," thought the Queen; "those tears are for
      him. I will <i>not</i> pity her."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she departed without returning an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen two halberdiers placed at the door of the chamber, and two
      others at the foot of the masked staircase by which she and Renard had
      approached, Mary proceeded with the ambassador to her own apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      On thinking over the recent occurrences, her feelings were so exasperated,
      that she exclaimed aloud, "Oh! that I could avenge myself on the perjured
      traitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show you how to avenge yourself," replied Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, then," returned the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unite yourself to my master, Philip of Spain," rejoined the ambassador.
      "Your cousin, the Emperor, highly desires the match. It will be an
      alliance worthy of you, and acceptable to your subjects. The Prince is a
      member of your own religion, and will enable you to restore its worship
      throughout your kingdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will think of it," replied Mary, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better <i>act</i> upon it," rejoined Renard. "The prince, besides his
      royal birth, is in all respects more richly endowed by nature than the
      Earl of Devonshire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have heard him accounted," replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty shall judge for yourself," rejoined Renard, producing a
      miniature. "Here is his portrait. The likeness is by no means flattering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must be very handsome," observed Mary, gazing at the miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is," replied Renard; "and his highness is as eager for the alliance as
      his imperial father. I have ventured to send him your majesty's portrait,
      and you shall hear in what rapturous terms he speaks of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      And taking several letters from his doublet, he selected one sealed with
      the royal arms of Spain, from which he read several highly complimentary
      remarks on Mary's personal appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough, sir," said Mary, checking him. "More unions are formed from pique
      than from affection, and mine will be one of them. I am resolved to
      affiance myself to the Prince of Spain, and that forthwith. I will not
      allow myself time to change my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness is in the right," observed Renard, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meet me at midnight in Saint John's Chapel in the White Tower," continued
      the queen, "where in your presence, and in the presence of Heaven, I will
      solemnly affiance myself to the prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty transports me by your determination," replied the
      ambassador. And full of joy at his unlooked-for success, he took his
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, as appointed, Renard repaired to Saint John's Chapel. He
      found the Queen, attended only by Feckenham, and kneeling before the
      altar, which blazed with numerous wax-lights. She had changed her dress
      for the ceremony, and was attired in, a loose robe of three-piled crimson
      velvet, trimmed with swansdown. Renard remained at a little distance, and
      looked on with a smile of Satanic triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had received the sacrament, and pronounced the "<i>Veni Creator</i>,"
      Mary motioned the ambassador towards her, and placing her right hand on a
      parchment lying on the altar, to which were attached the broad seals of
      England, addressed him thus:&mdash;"I have signed and sealed this
      instrument, by which I contract and affiance myself in marriage to Philip,
      Prince of Spain, son of his imperial majesty, Charles the Fifth. And I
      further give you, Simon Renard, representative of the prince, my
      irrevocable promise, in the face of the living God and his saints, that I
      will wed him and no other."

    <p>
      "May Heaven bless the union!" exclaimed Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the contract," pursued Mary, giving the parchment to Renard, who
      reverentially received it. "On my part, it is a marriage concluded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And equally so on the part of the prince, my master," replied Renard. "In
      his name I beg to express to your highness the deep satisfaction which
      this union will afford him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the present this contract must be kept secret, even from our privy
      councillors," said the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall never pass my lips," rejoined Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mine are closed by my sacred calling," added the confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty, I am sure, has done wisely in this step," observed Renard,
      "and, I trust, happily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust so too, sir," replied the Queen&mdash;"but time will show. These
      things are in the hands of the Great Disposer of events."

    <h2>
      XVI.&mdash;WHAT BEFEL CICELY IN THE SALT TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>orror-stricken by
      the discovery he had made of the body of the ill-fated Alexia, and not
      doubting from its appearance that she must have perished from starvation,
      Cholmondeley remained for some time in a state almost of stupefaction in
      the narrow chamber where it lay. Rousing himself, at length, he began to
      reflect that no further aid could be rendered her,&mdash;that she was now,
      at last, out of the roach of her merciless tormentor,&mdash;and that his
      attention ought, therefore, to be turned towards one who yet lived to
      suffer from his cruelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before departing, he examined the corpse more narrowly to ascertain
      whether it bore any marks of violence, and while doing so, a gleam of
      light called his attention to a small antique clasp fastening her tattered
      hood at the throat. Thinking it not impossible this might hereafter
      furnish some clue to the discovery of her real name and condition, he
      removed it. On holding it to the light, he thought he perceived an
      inscription upon it, but the characters were nearly effaced, and reserving
      the solution of the mystery for a more favourable opportunity, he
      carefully secured the clasp, and quitted the cell. He then returned to the
      passages he had recently traversed, explored every avenue afresh, reopened
      every cell-door, and after expending several hours in fruitless search,
      was compelled to abandon all hopes of finding Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day had long dawned when he emerged from the dungeon; and as he was slowly
      wending his way towards the Stone Kitchen, he descried Lawrence Nightfall
      advancing towards him. From the furious gestures of the jailor, he at once
      knew that he was discovered, and drawing his sword, he stood upon his
      defence. But a conflict was not what Nightgall desired. He shouted to the
      sentinels on the ramparts, and informing them that his keys had been
      stolen, demanded their assistance to secure the robber. Some half-dozen
      soldiers immediately descended, and Cholmondeley finding resistance in
      vain, thought fit to surrender. The keys being found upon him, were
      delivered to Nightgall, while he himself was conveyed to the guard-room
      near the By-ward Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had been detained there for some hours in close captivity,&mdash;not
      even being allowed to communicate with his friends in the Stone-kitchen,&mdash;Nightgall
      returned with an order from the council for his imprisonment in the Nun's
      Bower, whither he was forthwith removed. On the way to his place of
      confinement, he encountered Xit, and the friendly dwarf would fain have
      spoken with him, but he was kept at a distance by the halberts of the
      guard. He contrived, however, to inform him by sundry nods, winks, and
      expressive gestures, that he would keep a sharp watch upon the proceedings
      of Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen Cholmondeley safely bestowed, the jailor repaired to the
      entrance of the subterranean dungeons, and lighting a torch, opened the
      door of a small recess, from which he took a mattock and spade. Armed with
      these implements, he proceeded to the vault, beneath the Devilin Tower,
      where he commenced digging a grave. After labouring hard for a couple of
      hours, he attained a sufficient depth for his purpose, and taking the
      torch, ascended to the small chamber. Lifting the skeleton frame in his
      arms, he returned to the vault. In placing the torch on the ground it
      upset, and rolling into the grave was extinguished, leaving him in
      profound darkness. His first impulse was to throw down the body, but
      having, in his agitation, placed the hands, which were clasped together,
      over his neck, he found it impossible to free himself from it. His terror
      was so great that he uttered a loud cry, and would have fled, but his feet
      were rooted to the spot. He sank at last on his knees, and the corpse
      dropped upon him, its face coming into contact with his own. Grown
      desperate, at length, he disengaged himself from the horrible embrace, and
      threw the body into the grave. Relieved by this step from much of his
      fear, he felt about for the spade, and having found it, began to shovel in
      the mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0049" id="linkimage-0049"> </a>

      <a href="images/0287.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      While thus employed, he underwent a fresh alarm. In trampling down the
      mould, a hollow groan issued from the grave, trembling in every limb, he
      desisted from his task. His hair stood erect, and a thick damp gathered on
      his brow. Shaking off his terrors, he renewed his exertions, and in a
      short time his task was completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then groped his way out of the vault, and having become by long usage
      familiarized with its labyrinths, soon reached the entrance, where he
      struck a light, and having found a lantern, set fire to the candle within
      it. This done, he returned to the vault, where, to his great horror, he
      perceived that the face of the corpse was uncovered. Averting his gaze
      from it, he heaped the earth over it, and then flattened the mass with
      repeated blows of the spade. All trace of his victim being thus removed,
      and the vault restored to its original appearance, he took back the
      implements he had used, and struck into a passage leading in another
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing it for some time, he came to a strong door; unlocked it; and,
      ascending a flight of stone steps, reached another arched passage, which
      he swiftly traversed. After threading other passages with equal celerity,
      he came to a wider avenue, contrived under the eastern ramparts, and
      tracked it till it brought him to a flight of steps leading to a large
      octangular chamber, surrounded by eight deep recesses, and forming the
      basement story of the Salt Tower, at that time, and for upwards of a
      century afterwards, used as one of the prison lodgings of the fortress. In
      a chamber in the upper story of this fortification, now occupied as a
      drawing-room, is a curious sphere, carved a few years later than the date
      of this chronicle, by Hugh Draper, an astrologer, who was committed to the
      Tower on suspicion of sorcery.

      <a href="images/0289.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Quitting this chamber, Nightgall ascended a winding stone staircase which
      brought him to an arched door, leading to the room just described. Taking
      a key from the bunch at his girdle, he unlocked it, and entered the room.
      A female was seated in one corner with her face buried in her hands.
      Raising her head at his approach, she disclosed the features of Cicely.
      Her eyes were red with weeping&mdash;and her figure attenuated by long
      suffering. Conceiving from the savage expression of the jailor s
      countenance that he meditated some further act of cruelty, she uttered a
      loud shriek, and tried to avoid him.

      "Peace!" cried Nightgall, "I will do you no harm. Your retreat has been
      discovered. You must go with me to the tower leading to the Iron Gate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never go thither of my accord," replied Cicely. "Release me,
      villain. I will die sooner than become your bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see that," growled the jailer. "Another month's captivity will
      make you alter your tone. You shall never be set free, unless you consent
      to be mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall die a prisoner like your other victims," cried Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who told you I had other victims?" cried Nightgall, moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter who told me. I have heard Cuthbert Cholmondeley, whom I love as
      much as I hate you, speak of one&mdash;Alexia, I think she was named."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this," cried Nightgall, fiercely, "come along, or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" shrieked Cicely&mdash;"I will not go. You will murder me,"&mdash;And
      she filled the chamber with her screams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confusion!" cried Nightgall, "we shall be heard. Come along, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      In struggling to free herself from him, Cicely fell upon the ground,
      regardless of this, Nightgall dragged her by main, force through the
      doorway, and so down the secret staircase. She continued her screams,
      until her head striking against the stones, she was stunned by the blow,
      and became insensible. He then raised her in his arms, and descending
      another short flight of steps, traversed a narrow passage, and came to a
      dark chamber beneath the Tower leading to the Iron Gate.

      XVII.&mdash;OF THE CONSPIRACY FORMED BY DE NOAILLES; AND HOW XIT DELIVERED
      A LETTER TO ELIZABETH, AND VISITED COURTENAY IN THE LIEUTENANT'S LODGINGS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s soon as it was
      known that the Princess Elizabeth and Courtenay were placed under arrest,
      the greatest consternation prevailed throughout the Tower. While some few
      rejoiced in the favourite's downfall, the majority deplored it; and it was
      only the idea that when Mary's jealous indignation subsided, he would be
      restored to his former position, that prevented open expression being
      given to their sentiments. On being made acquainted with what had
      occurred, Gardiner instantly sought an audience of the Queen, and without
      attempting to defend Courtenay's conduct, he besought her earnestly to
      pause before she proceeded to extremities,&mdash;representing the yet
      unsettled state of her government, and how eagerly advantage would be
      taken of the circumstances to stir up dissension and rebellion. Mary
      replied that her feelings had been so greatly outraged that she was
      resolved upon vengeance, and that nothing but the Earl's life would
      satisfy her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this is your determination, madam," returned Gardiner,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I predict that the crown will not remain upon your head a month. Though
      the Earl of Devonshire has grievously offended your highness, his crime is
      not treason. And if you put him to death for this offence, you will
      alienate the hearts of all your subjects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," replied Mary, sternly. "No personal consideration shall deter
      me from my just revenge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what of the Princess Elizabeth?" asked the Bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She shall share his fate," answered the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This must not be, my gracious mistress," cried Gardiner, throwing himself
      at her feet. "Hero I will remain till I have driven these dark and
      vindictive feelings from your breast. Banish the Earl&mdash;take his life,
      if nothing else will content you,&mdash;but do not raise your hand against
      your sister."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bishop of Winchester," replied the Queen, "how many hours have you knelt
      before my father, Henry the Eighth, and have yet failed to turn him from
      his purpose! I am by nature as jealous&mdash;as firm&mdash;as obstinate,
      if you will&mdash;as he was. Arise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madam," replied Gardiner, "I will not rise till I have convinced you
      of your error. Your august father was a prince of high and noble
      qualities, but the defects that clouded his royal nature would show to
      double disadvantage in one of your sex. Dismiss all thought of this
      faithless Earl from your heart,&mdash;banish him from your presence, from
      your kingdom,&mdash;nay, keep him in durance if you will, but use no harsh
      measures against the Princess Elizabeth. Every step taken against her will
      be fearfully resented by the Protestant party, of which, I need not remind
      you, she is the representative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what matter if it be, my lord?" rejoined Mary. "I am strong enough to
      maintain my own authority, and shall be right glad of some plea to put
      down heresy and schism by fire and sword. You are not wont to advocate
      this cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor do I advocate it now, madam," returned Gardiner. "All I counsel is
      prudence. You are not yet strong enough to throw off the mask of
      toleration which you have hitherto worn. Your first parliament has not yet
      met. The statutes establishing the Reformed religion are yet unrepealed,&mdash;nay,
      though I shame to speak it, the marriage of your illustrious parents has
      not yet been confirmed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You <i>should</i> shame to speak it, my lord," rejoined Mary, fiercely;
      "for it is mainly by your machinations that the divorce was obtained."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I own it to my sorrow," replied Gardiner, "but I then owed the same
      obedience to your illustrious sire that I now owe to your highness. I did
      your injured mother great wrong, but if I live I will repair it. This,
      however, is foreign to the subject. Your majesty may believe me when I
      tell you, your worst enemies could not desire you to take a more
      injudicious step, or one more fraught with danger to yourself, than to
      strain your prerogative against Courtenay and Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were I to assent to your request and set them free," replied
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary, after a moment's reflection, "the first act of the princess would be
      to unite herself to this perfidious villain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think it," replied Gardiner. "But what if she were to do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>What!</i>" exclaimed Mary, furiously. "The thought revives all my
      indignation. Am I so tame of spirit that I can bear to see him whom I have
      loved united to a rival I hate? No, my lord, I am not. This is no doubtful
      case. I have heard his treachery with my own ears&mdash;seen it with my
      own eyes&mdash;and I will terribly avenge myself. Courtenay never again
      shall behold Elizabeth. He has breathed his last false sigh&mdash;uttered
      his last perjured profession of love&mdash;exchanged his last look, unless
      they meet upon the scaffold. You know not what an injured woman feels. I
      <i>have</i> the power of avenging myself, and, by my father's head, I will
      use it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when you have gratified this fell passion, madam," returned Gardiner,
      "remorse will succeed, and you will bitterly regret what you have done.
      Since nothing better may be,&mdash;and if you will not nobly, and like
      yourself, pardon the offenders,&mdash;at least reflect before you act. If
      you persist in your present intention, it will be the duty of all your
      faithful subjects to prepare for a rebellion, for such will certainly
      ensue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make what preparations you deem fitting, my lord," replied Mary. "In my
      father's time the people did not dare to resist his decrees, however
      arbitrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The people are no longer what they were, madam, nor are you&mdash;for I
      must make bold to say so&mdash;in the position, or backed by the power of
      your dread father. What he did is no rule for you. I am no advocate for
      Courtenay&mdash;nor for the princess Elizabeth. Could you avenge yourself
      upon them with safety, though I should lament it, I would not oppose you.
      But you cannot do so. Others must bleed at the same time. Remember the
      Lady Jane Gray and her husband yet live. You will revive their faction&mdash;and
      must of necessity doom them to death to prevent another rebellion. Once
      begun, there will be no end to bloodshed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are cogent reasons, my lord," returned Mary, after a moment's
      reflection,&mdash;"supposing them well-founded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And trust me, they <i>are</i> well-founded, gracious madam," replied the
      Bishop. "Do not sacrifice your kingdom&mdash;do not sacrifice the holy
      Catholic church which looks to you for support&mdash;to an insane thirst
      of vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gardiner," replied Mary, taking his hand and looking at him earnestly,
      "you know not how I have loved this man. Put yourself in my position. How
      would you act?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I am assured your highness would, if you were not under the dominion
      of passion," replied the bishop&mdash;"forgive him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would do so," rejoined Mary, "but oh! if he were to wed Elizabeth, I
      should die. I would rather yield them my crown,&mdash;my life,&mdash;than
      consent to their espousals. But I will not think for myself. Arise, my
      lord. Give me your counsel, and what you recommend I will follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spoken like yourself, gracious madam," replied the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was sure your noble nature could soon triumph over unworthy thoughts.
      Since your highness thinks it possible Courtenay may wed Elizabeth, I
      would advise you to detain him for the present a captive in the Tower. But
      instantly liberate the princess&mdash;dismiss her from your court&mdash;and
      let her retire to Ashbridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like your advice well, my lord," replied the Queen, "and will act upon
      it. The princess shall set out to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot too highly applaud your highness's determination," replied
      Gardiner; "but as you have spoken thus frankly, may I venture to ask
      whether the earl's case is utterly hopeless?&mdash;whether, after he has
      sufficiently felt the weight of your displeasure you will not restore him
      to your favour&mdash;to your affections?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," replied Mary, firmly, "never. And could you counsel it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is inexperienced, madam," urged the bishop; "and after this salutary
      lesson&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more, my lord," interrupted the Queen, a shade passing over her
      features, "it is too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too late!" echoed Gardiner. "Am I to understand your highness has made
      another engagement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to understand nothing more than you are told, my lord," replied
      Mary, angrily. "In due season you shall know all."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Gardiner bowed in acquiescence, he perceived the miniature of Philip of
      Spain lying on the table, and a sudden apprehension of the truth crossed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one person upon whom I should chiefly desire your highness's
      choice <i>not</i> to fall,1' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is&mdash;?" interrupted Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip of Spain," answered Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What objections have you to him, my lord?" demanded the queen, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My objections are threefold," rejoined Gardiner. "First, I dislike the
      tyrannical character of the prince, which would be ill-suited to render
      your highness's union a happy one. Secondly, I am assured that the match
      would be disagreeable to your subjects&mdash;the English nation not being
      able to brook a foreign yoke; and of all dominations none being so
      intolerable as that of Spain. Thirdly, the alliance would plunge us in
      endless wars with France&mdash;a country that would never tamely submit to
      such a formidable extension of power, as this would prove, on the part of
      its old enemy, Charles the Fifth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If not Philip of Spain, whom would you recommend me?" asked Mary, who was
      anxious to mislead him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of your own nobles," replied Gardiner; "by which means your authority
      would be unabridged. Whereas, if you wed a prince, odious for his tyranny
      in the eyes of all Europe"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this, my lord," interrupted Mary, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said Gardiner, "however I may risk displeasing you, I should be
      wanting in duty, in loyalty, and in sincerity, were I not strongly to warn
      you against a match with Philip of Spain. It will be fatal to your own
      happiness&mdash;fatal to the welfare of your people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said it is too late," sighed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty has not affianced yourself to him," cried Gardiner,
      anxiously..
    </p>
    <p>
      "Question me no further," rejoined Mary. "What is done is done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! madam," cried Gardiner, "I understand your words too well. You have
      taken a perilous step, at the instigation of evil counsellors, and under
      the influence of evil passions. God grant good may come of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are mere surmises on your part, my lord," returned Mary. "I have
      not told you I have taken any step."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your majesty leads me to infer it," answered the bishop. "For your
      own sake, and for the sake of your kingdom, I trust my fears are
      unfounded."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, an usher approached, and informed the queen that the imperial
      ambassador, Simon Renard, desired an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admit him," said Mary. "Farewell, my lord," she added, turning to
      Gardiner; "I will weigh what you have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Act upon it, gracious madam, if you <i>can</i>," rejoined the bishop.
      "But if you are so far committed as to be unable to retreat, count upon my
      best services to aid you in the difficulty." At this moment, Simon Renard
      entered the audience-chamber, and the expression of his countenance was so
      exulting, that Gardiner was convinced his conjectures were not far wide of
      the truth. His first object, on quitting the royal presence, was to seek
      out Feckenham, from whom he succeeded in eliciting the fact of the
      betrothment in Saint John's chapel; and with a breast full of trouble he
      returned to his own apartments. On the way thither, he encountered De
      Noailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well met, my lord," cried the ambassador. "I was about to seek you. So,
      it seems all our projects are ruined. Courtenay is disgraced and
      imprisoned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His folly has destroyed the fairest chance that ever man possessed,"
      observed the bishop. "He is now irretrievably lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not irretrievably, I trust, my good lord," replied Do Noailles. "A
      woman's mind is proverbially changeful. And when this jealous storm is
      blown over, I doubt not he will, again bask in the full sunshine of royal
      favour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency is in the wrong," rejoined Gardiner. "The queen will
      never forgive him, or, what is equally to be lamented, will never unite
      herself to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak confidently, my lord," returned Do Noailles gravely. "I trust
      nothing has occurred to warrant what you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. De Noailles," said the bishop significantly, "look to yourself. The
      party of France is on the decline. That of Spain is on the ascendant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What mean you, my lord?" cried the ambassador, eagerly. "Renard has not
      succeeded in his aim? Mary has not affianced herself to the Prince of
      Spain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing positively," replied Gardiner evasively. "I merely throw
      out the hint. It is for you to follow it up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This were a blow, indeed!" cried De Noailles. "But subtle as Renard is,
      and with all the advantage he has gained, I will yet countermine him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall not want my aid," returned Gardiner, "provided you hatch no
      treason against the queen. And that you may the better know how to act,
      learn that her majesty <i>is</i> affianced to Philip of Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curses on the crafty Spaniard!" exclaimed De Noailles, furiously. "But I
      will yet defeat him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The princess Elizabeth will be liberated to-day, and sent with a strong
      guard to Ashbridge," remarked Gardiner. "Courtenay will be kept a prisoner
      in the Tower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must find means to liberate him," rejoined the ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this you must proceed without my aid," said the bishop. "If it be
      possible to reinstate the earl in Mary's favour, it shall be done. But I
      can take no part in aiding his flight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it to me, my lord," rejoined De Noailles. "All I require is your
      voice with the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you may rely on," answered the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, they separated; Gardiner proceeding to his own apartments, and
      De Noailles bending his steps towards the green, debating with himself, as
      he wended thither, what course it would be best to pursue in the
      emergency. Nothing occurred to him but expedients so hazardous that he
      instantly dismissed them. While resolving these matters, as he walked to
      and fro beneath the avenue, he was accosted by Xit, who, doffing his cap,
      and making a profound bow, inquired whether the rumour was correct that
      the Earl of Devonshire had incurred the queen's displeasure and was
      imprisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, marry is it," replied De Noailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am truly concerned to hear it," replied the mannikin; "and I make no
      doubt his lordship's disgrace is owing to the machinations of his mortal
      foe, Simon Renard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou art in the right," replied De Noailles. "And let it be known
      throughout the Tower that this is the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not fail to spread it among my fellows," replied Xit. "But none
      can lament it more than myself. I would lay down my life for his
      lordship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" exclaimed De Noailles. "This knave may be useful," he muttered.
      "Harkee, sirrah! Canst thou devise some safe plan by which a letter may be
      conveyed to the earl, who is imprisoned in the lieutenant's lodgings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency could not have chanced upon one more able or willing to
      serve you," replied Xit. "Give me the letter, and I will engage it shall
      reach its destination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to my lodgings this evening," said De Noailles, "and it shall be
      ready for thee. As yet, my plan is not matured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency may depend upon me," replied the dwarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I conclude, if I perform my task to your satisfaction, I shall be
      rewarded?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amply," replied De Noailles. "Take this purse in earnest of what is to
      follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not desire gold," returned the dwarf, restoring the purse. "What I
      aspire to is rank. I am tired of being attendant to three gluttonous
      giants. If the Earl of Devonshire is restored by my means to liberty and
      to the position he has lost with the queen, I trust the service will not
      be unremembered, but that I may be promoted to some vacant post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubt it not," replied De Noailles, who could scarcely help laughing at
      the dwarfs overweening vanity. "I will answer for it, if thou performest
      thy part well, thou shalt be knighted ere a month be past. But I will put
      thy skill further to the test. The princess Elizabeth will be removed from
      the Tower to-day. Thou must find some means of delivering a letter to her,
      unperceived by her attendants."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do it," replied Xit, unhesitatingly. "Knighted, did your
      excellency say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, knighted," returned De Noailles,&mdash;"within a month. Follow me. I
      will prepare the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      It being the ambassador's wish to carry on a secret correspondence with
      the princess, he pondered upon the safest means of accomplishing his
      object; and chancing to notice a guitar, which had been lent him by
      Elizabeth, it occurred to him that it would form an excellent medium of
      communication. Accordingly, he set to work; and being well versed in
      various state ciphers, speedily traced a key to the system beneath the
      strings of the instrument. He then despatched it by a page to the
      princess, who, immediately comprehending that some mystery must be
      attached to it, laid it aside to take with her to Ashbridge. Do Noailles,
      meanwhile, wrote a few hasty lines on a piece of paper, explaining his
      motive in sending the guitar, and delivering it to Xit, charged him, as he
      valued his life, not to attempt to give it the princess, unless he could
      do so unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon, Elizabeth, escorted by Sir Edward Hastings, and a large guard,
      left the palace. She was on horseback, and as she rode through the gateway
      of the By-ward Tower, Xit, who had stationed himself on Og's shoulder,
      took off his bonnet, and let it fall as if by accident, on her steed's
      head. Startled by the blow, the animal reared, and in the confusion that
      ensued, the dwarf contrived to slip the billet unperceived into her hand.
      As soon as the cavalcade had passed on, and the dwarf had undergone a
      severe rebuke from Og and the other warders for his supposed carelessness,
      he hastened to the ambassador's room, to relate the successful issue of
      his undertaking. De Noailles was overjoyed by the intelligence;
      complimented him on his skill; promised him still higher dignities in case
      of success; and bade him return in the evening for further orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the day was consumed by the ambassador in revolving his
      project. The more he reflected upon the matter, the more convinced he
      became, that in the present critical state of affairs, nothing could be
      done without some daring conspiracy; and after a long debate, he conceived
      a scheme which would either overthrow Mary's government altogether, and
      place Elizabeth on the throne, or reduce the former to such an abject
      state that he could dictate his own terms to her. On consideration,
      thinking it better not to write to the Earl for fear of mischance, he
      entrusted Xit with a message to him, earnestly impressing upon the dwarf
      the necessity of caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of all this plotting, it has been stated, was confined in the
      lieutenant's lodgings. Every consideration due to his rank and peculiar
      position was shown him by Sir Henry Bedingfeld. He was permitted to occupy
      the large chamber on the second floor, since noted as the scene of the
      examinations of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. He was, however, strictly
      guarded. No one was allowed to hold any communication with him, either
      personally or by letter, except through the medium of the lieutenant. And
      every article either of attire or furniture that was brought him was
      carefully inspected before it was delivered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit, who, as a privileged person, went and came where he pleased, found
      little difficulty in obtaining admittance to the lieutenant's lodgings.
      But all his cunning could not procure him a sight of the prisoner, and
      after wasting several hours in fruitless attempts, being fearful of
      exciting suspicion, he was compelled for that night to relinquish the
      design. The next day, he was equally unsuccessful, and he was almost
      driven to his wits' end with perplexity, when as he was passing beneath a
      tree at the southern extremity of the green, he chanced to cast his eye
      upwards, and saw a cat spring from one of the topmost branches on to the
      roof of the Bloody Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wherever a cat can go, I can," thought Xit; "That roof reached, I could
      pass along the summits of the ramparts and fortifications connecting it
      with the lieutenant's lodgings; and on arriving there, it were easy to
      descend the chimney, and get into the earl's chamber. Bravo! That will
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan so enchanted him, that he was in a fever to put it in execution.
      This, however, could not take place till night, and retiring to a little
      distance to survey the premises, he satisfied himself, after some
      consideration, that he had discovered the chimney communicating with the
      earl's room. When the proper time arrived, he cautiously approached the
      tree, and looking round to make sure no one observed him, he clambered up
      it with the agility of a squirrel. Notwithstanding his caution, a serious
      accident had nearly befallen him. Just as he was about to spring upon the
      wall, the bough on which he stood broke. Luckily he caught hold of a
      projection of the building, and saved himself. But he was some minutes
      before he recovered from the fright. The noise, too, had nearly betrayed
      him to the sentinels, who approached within a few paces of him. But the
      darkness was so profound, that he escaped observation. When they returned
      to their posts he proceeded along the ridge of the battlements, and
      dropping upon the ballium wall, proceeded with the utmost caution to the
      edge of the ramparts. He then passed on tip-toe close to the guard, and
      hastening forward, reached the tiled roof of the lieutenant's house, up
      which he clambered, as noiselessly and actively as the animal he emulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      On gaining the chimney he was in search of, he untied a cord with which he
      had provided himself, and securing it to the brickwork, let one end drop
      down the aperture. He then descended, and soon came to a level with the
      chamber, and perceiving a light within it, resolved to reconnoitre before
      he ventured further. Courtenay was asleep on a couch in the corner, while
      two attendants were likewise slumbering upon seats near the door. At a
      loss how to act, as he could scarcely awaken the earl without disturbing
      the guards, Nit got out of the chimney, and crept cautiously towards the
      couch. He would fain have extinguished the lamp, but it was out of his
      reach. Planting himself on the further side of the couch, so as to conceal
      himself from the attendants, he ventured at length slightly to shake the
      sleeper. Courtenay started, and uttered an exclamation which immediately
      aroused his guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who touched me?" he demanded angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one, my lord," replied the foremost of the men, glancing at the door
      and round the chamber. "Your lordship must have been dreaming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it must be so," replied the carl, looking round, and perceiving
      nothing. "And yet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a slight pressure on the hand warned him to be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your lordship wishes it, we will search the room," observed the second
      soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, it is needless," replied Courtenay. "I have no doubt it was a
      dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes, the soldiers were again snoring, and Xit popping his
      head from beneath the coverlet, in a low tone delivered his message. The
      earl expressed his satisfaction, and proceeded to make inquiries
      respecting the Princess Elizabeth. On learning that she had quitted the
      Tower the day before, he had much ado to restrain his joy. And when he
      ascertained by what means the dwarf had obtained access to the chamber, he
      was desirous to attempt an escape by the same way, but was dissuaded by
      Xit, who represented to him the risk he would incur, adding that even if
      he escaped from his present prison, he would be unable to quit the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dwarf then departed as he came. Climbing up the chimney, he drew the
      rope after him, retraced his course over the fortifications; and on
      reaching the Bloody Tower, contrived, with much exertion, and no little
      risk, to lay hold of a branch of the tree, down which he clambered. The
      next day, he related the successful issue of his trip to his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Noailles did not remain idle. He had already mentioned his project to
      the Duke of Suffolk, Lord Thomas Grey, Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, Sir
      James Croft, Sir Peter Carew, and Sir Thomas Wyat, all of whom eagerly
      joined in it. With most of these, but especially with Wyat,&mdash;afterwards
      the leader of the rebellion against Mary,&mdash;the main inducement to
      conspire was aversion to the Queen's meditated alliance with the Prince of
      Spain. With the Duke of Suffolk and his ambitious brother, Lord Thomas
      Grey, it was, (as De Noailles had foreseen,) the hope that in the tumult
      the Lady Jane Grey might be restored, that purchased their compliance. The
      conspirators had frequent secret meetings in the apartments of the French
      ambassador, where they conferred upon their plans. Suffolk, though
      pardoned for his late treason by Mary, was yet detained a prisoner on
      parole within the Tower. His brother had not taken a sufficiently
      prominent part to bring him into trouble. The bravest of their number was
      Wyat, of whom it may be necessary to say a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inheriting the wit and valour of his father, the refined and courtly poet
      of the same name, Sir Thomas Wyat of Allingham Castle in Kent, had already
      earned for himself the highest character as a military leader. His
      father's friend, the chivalrous and poetical Earl of Surrey, in one of his
      despatches to Henry the Eighth, thus describes his conduct at the siege of
      Boulogne:&mdash;"I assure your Majesty, you have framed him to such
      towardness and knowledge in the war, that (none other dispraised) your
      Majesty hath not many like him within your realm, for hardiness,
      painfulness, circumspection, and natural disposition for the war." Wyat
      was in the very flower of his age. But his long service,&mdash;for from
      his earliest youth, he had embraced the profession of arms,&mdash;had
      given him an older look than his years warranted. He was of middle-size,
      strongly but symmetrically proportioned, with handsome boldly-carved
      features, of a somewhat stern expression. His deportment partook of his
      frank soldier-like character. In swordsmanship, horsemanship, and all
      matters connected with the business of war, he was, as may be supposed,
      eminently skilful.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much deliberation, it was agreed among the conspirators to have all
      in readiness for a general insurrection, but to defer their project until
      the meeting of parliament, when the Queen's intentions respecting her
      alliance with Spain would be declared, and if what they anticipated should
      prove true, the whole nation would favour their undertaking.

      XVIII.&mdash;HOW COURTENAY ESCAPED FROM THE TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the great
      outbreak was thus deferred, it was deemed expedient to liberate Courtenay
      as soon as possible. Such were the precautions taken by the vigilant Sir
      Henry Bedingfeld, that this was not so easy of accomplishment as it
      appeared on the onset. At length, however, all was arranged, and Xit was
      despatched to the earl to tell him the attempt might be made on the
      following night, when unluckily, just as the mannikin had entered the
      chimney, one of the guards awakened, and hearing a noise, flew to see what
      occasioned it. Exerting his utmost agility, the dwarf was soon out of
      reach, and the attendant could not distinguish his person, but he
      instantly gave the alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flying for his life, Xit got out of the chimney, hurried along the tops of
      the ramparts, and jumping at the hazard of his neck, into the tree,
      reached the ground just as the alarm was given to the sentinels. It was
      past midnight. But Sir Henry Bedingfeld, aroused from his couch, instantly
      repaired to the chamber of his prisoner. Nothing could be found but the
      rope by which Xit had descended, and which in his hasty retreat he had not
      been able to remove. Courtenay refused to answer any interrogations
      respecting his visiter, and after a long and fruitless search, the
      lieutenant departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the occurrence was made known to the queen, and at her
      request Simon Renard visited the prisoner. Not thinking his place of
      confinement secure enough, Renard suggested that he should be removed to
      the Bell Tower,&mdash;a fortification flanking the lieutenant's habitation
      on the west, and deriving its name, as has already been mentioned, from
      the alarm-bell of the fortress, which was placed in a small wooden belfry
      on its roof. This tower is still in existence, and devoted to the same
      purpose as of old,&mdash;though its chambers, instead of being used as
      prison-lodgings, form the domestic offices of the governor. In shape it is
      circular, like all the other towers, with walls of great thickness pierced
      by narrow loopholes, admitting light to the interior. Courtenay was
      confined in a small room on the basement floor, having a vaulted roof
      supported by pointed arches of curious construction, with deep recesses in
      the intervals. From this strong and gloomy cell it seemed impossible he
      could escape; and having seen him placed within it, Renard departed fully
      satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0055" id="linkimage-0055"> </a>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0305.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When the intelligence of the earl's removal was brought to De Noailles, he
      was greatly disheartened; but Xit bade him be of good cheer, as he still
      felt certain of effecting his deliverance. Some time, however, elapsed
      before any new scheme could be devised; when one night Xit appeared with a
      smiling countenance, and said he had found means of communicating with the
      prisoner. On being questioned as to how he had contrived this, he replied
      that he had crept up to a loophole opening into the earl's chamber, and
      filed away one of the iron bars; and though the aperture was not large
      enough to allow a full-grown man to pass through it, he had done so
      without inconvenience, and under cover of night without being perceived.
      He then proceeded to detail a somewhat hazardous plan of flight, which
      Courtenay had determined to risk, provided his friends would second the
      attempt. All the earl required was, that a well-manned boat should be in
      waiting for him near the Tower-wharf, to put off the instant he reached
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some consideration, this plan was held feasible, and Sir Thomas Wyat
      undertook the command of the boat. A dark night being indispensable for
      the enterprise, the third from that time, when there would be no moon, was
      chosen; and this arrangement was communicated by the dwarf to Courtenay.
      Measures were then concerted between the earl and his assistant, and all
      being settled, it was agreed, to avoid heedless risk, that the latter
      should not return again till the appointed night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On its arrival, Xit, as soon as it grew dark, crept through the loophole,
      and found the earl impatiently expecting him. He was alone, for since his
      removal to so strong a prison it was deemed needless to have an attendant
      constantly with him. Xit brought him a rapier and dagger, and a long coil
      of rope, and when he had armed himself with the weapons, they proceeded to
      the execution of their project. Knocking at the door, the earl summoned
      the warder who was stationed outside. The man immediately obeyed the call,
      and as he opened the door Xit crept behind it, and while Courtenay engaged
      the warder's attention, he slipped out, and concealed himself behind a
      projection in the winding stairs. The earl having made a demand which he
      knew would compel the warder to proceed to Sir Henry Bedingfeld, dismissed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quitting the cell, the warder, who had no suspicions, locked the door,
      leaving the key,&mdash;as had been foreseen,&mdash;within it. He then
      ascended the stairs, and passed close to Xit without perceiving him. As
      soon as he was gone, the dwarf unlocked the door, and made good his own
      retreat through the loophole; it being necessary he should give the signal
      to the party on the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay then hurried up the winding steps. On reaching the upper
      chamber, he perceived it was vacant&mdash;but the open door showed him
      that the warder had just passed through it. Hastily shutting it, and
      barring it withinside, he mounted a short flight of steps leading to the
      roof, where he knew a sentinel who had charge of the alarm-bell was
      stationed. Before the man, who was leaning upon his partizan, could utter
      an exclamation, Courtenay snatched the weapon from him, and dealt him a
      blow that stretched him senseless at his feet. He then quickly fastened
      the rope to one of the stout wooden supporters of the belfry, and flinging
      the coil over the battlements, prepared to descend by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possessed of great strength and activity, and materially aided by the
      roughened surface of the old walls, and other irregularities in the
      structure, against which he placed his feet, the earl reached the ground
      in safety. He was now in the outer ward, near the By-ward Tower. It was so
      dark that his descent had not been noticed, but he perceived several
      soldiers passing at a little distance from him, from whose remarks he
      gathered that they were about to convey the keys of the fortress to the
      lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they had passed him, he rushed across the ward in the direction
      of the arched passage leading to the drawbridge. Here he encountered Og,
      who was on guard at the time. The gigantic warder immediately challenged
      him, and presented his huge halbert at his breast. But the earl, without
      making any reply, stooped down, and before he could be prevented, darted
      through his legs. Og, in a voice of thunder, gave the alarm, and was
      instantly answered by a party of halberdiers, who rushed out of the
      adjoining guard-room. They were all armed, some with pikes, some with
      arquebusses, and snatching a torch from the soldier nearest him, Og darted
      after the fugitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the earl's flight from the Bell Tower had been discovered.
      On his return, finding the door barred withinside, the warder suspected
      something wrong, and gave the alarm. A few seconds sufficed to the
      men-at-arms to break down the door with their bills, and they then found
      what had occurred. The alarm-bell was instantly rung, and word passed to
      the sentinels on the By-ward Tower, and on the other fortifications, that
      the Earl of Devonshire had escaped. In an instant, all was in motion.
      Torches gleamed along the whole line of ramparts; shouts were heard in
      every direction; and soldiers hastened to each point whence it was
      conceived likely he would attempt to break forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before relating the result of the attempt, it may be proper to advert to
      what had been done in furtherance of it by Xit. Having got through the
      loophole as before related, the dwarf pursued the course subsequently
      taken by Courtenay, made a hasty excuse to Og, and crossed the drawbridge
      just before it was raised. Approaching the side of the river, he drew a
      petronel, and flashing it, the signal was immediately answered by the
      sound of muffled oars; and Xit, whose gaze was steadfastly bent upon the
      stream, could just detect a boat approaching the strand. The next moment,
      Sir Thomas Wyat sprang ashore, and as Xit was explaining to him in a
      whisper what had occurred, the alarm was given as above related.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment of intense interest to all concerned in the enterprise,
      and Wyat held himself in readiness for action. On reaching the drawbridge
      and finding it raised, Courtenay without hesitation bounded over the
      rails, and plunging into the moat, struck out towards the opposite bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0056" id="linkimage-0056"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/0308.jpg" alt="0308 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0308.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At this juncture, Og and his companions arrived at the outlet. The giant
      held his torch over the moat, and perceived the earl swimming across it. A
      soldier beside him levelled his arquebuss at the fugitive, and would have
      fired, but Og checked him, crying, "Beware how you harm the queen's
      favourite. It is the Earl of Devonshire. Seize him, but injure him not&mdash;or
      dread her majesty's displeasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      The caution, however, was unheeded by those on the summit of the By-ward
      Tower. Shots were fired from it, and the balls speckled the surface of the
      water, but without doing any damage. One of Wyat's crew hastened to the
      edge of the moat, and throwing a short line into the water, assisted the
      earl to land.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, the drawbridge was lowered, and Og and his
      companions rushed across it&mdash;too late, however, to secure the
      fugitive. As soon as Courtenay had gained a footing on the wharf, Sir
      Thomas Wyat seized his hand, and hurried him towards the boat, into which
      they leaped. The oars were then plunged into the water, and before their
      pursuers gained the bank, the skiff had shot to some distance from it.
      Another boat was instantly manned and gave chase, but without effect. The
      obscurity favoured the fugitives. Wyat directed his men to pull towards
      London Bridge, and they soon disappeared beneath its narrow arches.

      XIX.&mdash;HOW QUEEN MARY VISITED THE LIONS' TOWER; HOW MAGOG GAVE HIS
      DAME A LESSON; AND HOW XIT CONQUERED A MONKEY, AND WAS WORSTED BY A BEAR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ourtenay's escape
      from the Tower created almost as much sensation as his imprisonment had
      done; and while his partisans were cheered by it, his enemies were
      proportionately discouraged. Several bands of soldiers, headed by trusty
      leaders, were sent in pursuit of him in different directions; but no trace
      could be discovered of the course he had taken; nor could all the
      vigilance of Sir Henry Bedingfeld detect who had assisted him in his
      flight. After some time, as no tidings were heard of him, it was concluded
      he had embarked for France. Inspired by jealousy, Mary immediately sent an
      order to Ashbridge to double the guard over her sister; and she secretly
      instructed Sir Edward Hastings, in case of any attempt to set her free, to
      convey her instantly to the Tower. Elizabeth either was severely
      indisposed, or feigned to be so, and it was bruited abroad that poison had
      been given her. This rumour, which obtained general credence, as well as
      others to the effect that her life had been attempted by different means,
      at length reached the queen's ears, and occasioned her great distress and
      annoyance. To remove the suspicion, she commanded Elizabeth's appearance
      at court. And though the princess would fain have refused, she was
      compelled to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weeks had now elapsed since Courtenay's flight, and during that time
      the queen's anger had so much abated, that Gardiner thought he might
      venture to solicit his pardon, he-presenting to her, that she had already
      punished him sufficiently by the disgrace she had inflicted upon him, and
      that it was desirable to give no pretext for tumult during the momentous
      discussions which would take place on the meeting of parliament,&mdash;then
      immediately about to be assembled,&mdash;he urged his suit so warmly, that
      in the end Mary consented to pardon the carl, provided he appeared at
      court within three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligence of the queen's change of feeling was soon conveyed to
      Courtenay, who had been concealed in an obscure lodging in London, and on
      the second day he presented himself before her. Mary received him
      graciously but coldly, and in such a manner as to convince him and his
      friends, if they still indulged any such hopes, that a restoration to the
      place he had once held in her affections was out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are disposed to travel, my lord," she said, sarcastically, "I will
      take care you have such appointments to foreign courts as will best suit
      your age and inclination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty has perchance some delicate mission at the Court of Madrid,
      which you desire me to execute," replied the earl, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had I any mission to that court," replied the Queen, repressing her
      emotion, "it is not to your hands I should entrust it. You have offended
      me once, Courtenay. Beware how you do so a second time. Abandon all hopes
      of Elizabeth. She never can be&mdash;never <i>shall be</i> yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That remains to be seen," muttered Courtenay as he quitted the presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview over, Courtenay was joined by De Noailles, and, from that
      moment, he surrendered himself unresistingly to the designs of the artful
      ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary had now removed her court to Whitehall. But she frequently visited
      the Tower, and appeared to prefer its gloomy chambers to the gorgeous
      halls in her other palaces. One night, an order was received by Hairun,
      the bearward, who had charge of the wild animals, that, on the following
      day, the Queen would visit the menagerie. Preparations were accordingly
      made for her reception; and the animals were deprived of their supper,
      that they might exhibit an unusual degree of ferocity. But though Hairun
      starved the wild beasts, he did not act in like manner towards himself. On
      the contrary, he deemed it a fitting occasion to feast his-friends, and
      accordingly invited Magog, his dame, the two other giants, Xit, Ribald,
      and the pantler and his spouse, to take their evening meal with him. The
      invitation was gladly accepted; and about the hour of a modern dinner, the
      guests repaired to the bearward's lodgings, which were situated in the
      basement chamber of the Lions' Tower. Of this structure, nothing but an
      arched embrasure, once overlooking the lesser moat, and another
      subterranean room, likewise boasting four deep arched recesses, but
      constantly flooded with water, now remain. A modern dwelling-house,
      tenanted by the former keeper of the menagerie in the fortress, occupies
      the site of the ancient fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aware of the appetites of his friends, and being no despicable trencherman
      himself, Hairun had provided accordingly. The principal dish was a wild
      boar, a present to the bearward from Sir Henry Bedingfeld, which having
      been previously soaked for a fortnight, in a mixture of vinegar, salt,
      bruised garlic, and juniper-berries, was roasted whole under the personal
      superintendence of Peter Trusbut, who predicted it would prove delicious
      eating&mdash;and the result proved him no false prophet. On the appearance
      of this magnificent dish, which succeeded the first course of buttered
      stock-fish, and mutton pottage, a murmur of delight pervaded the company.
      The eyes of the giants glistened, their mouths watered, and they grasped
      their knives and forks like men preparing for a combat to the utterance.
      Magog had seated himself as far from his wife as possible. But she was too
      much engrossed by the assiduous attention, of Ribald, to take any
      particular notice of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Trusbut, as usual, officiated as carver. And the manner in which he
      distributed slices of the savoury and juicy meat, which owing to the
      preparation it had undergone, had a tenderness and mellowness wholly
      indescribable, with modicums of the delicate fat, elicited the host's
      warmest approbation. The giants spoke not a word; and even the ladies
      could only express their delight by interjections. Reserving certain
      delicate morsels for himself, Peter Trusbut, with a zeal worthy of the
      cause in which he was engaged, continued to ply his knife so
      unremittingly, that no one's plate was for a moment empty, and yet with
      all this employment, he did not entirely forget himself. Hairun was in
      ecstacies; and while the giants were still actively engaged, he placed
      before them enormous goblets filled with bragget, a drink composed of
      strong ale sweetened with honey, spiced and flavoured with herbs. At the
      first pause, the gigantic brethren drained their cups; and they were
      promptly replenished by the hospitable bearward. By this time, the greater
      part of the boar had disappeared. Its well-flavoured back and fattened
      flanks were gone, and the hams and head alone remained. Seeing that the
      other guests were satisfied, the pantler, with some little labour, hewed
      off the two legs, and giving one to each of the unmarried giants, assigned
      the head to Magog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mauger himself never did his office with greater dexterity than you have
      displayed in decapitating that wild boar, master pantler," observed Magog,
      smiling as he received the welcome gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not going to eat all that, you insatiable cormorant," cried his
      dame, from the other end of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, but I am, sweetheart," replied Magog, commencing operations on
      the cheek; "wherefore not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wherefore not," screamed Dame Placida, "because you'll die of an
      apoplexy, and I shall be a second time a widow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter," replied the giant, "I'm weary of life, and cannot end it more
      comfortably.&mdash;I'll eat in spite of her," he added, half aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last remark, in spite of Ribald's interference, might have called
      forth some practical rejoinder on the part of his wife, had not her
      attention and that of the rest of the company been drawn, at the moment,
      towards Xit. Amongst other animals allowed to range about the bearward's
      house, was a small mischievous ape. This creature had seated itself behind
      Xit's chair, where it made the most grotesque grimaces in imitation of the
      mannikin. The guests were at first too much occupied to take any notice of
      its proceedings, and Xit, wholly unconscious of its presence, pursued his
      repast in tranquillity. The more substantial viands disposed of, he helped
      himself to some roasted chesnuts, and was greedily munching them, when the
      monkey stretched its arm over his shoulder, and snatched a handful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Astonished and alarmed at the occurrence, Xit turned to regard the
      intruder. But when he perceived the ape's grinning face close to his own,
      and heard the shouts and laughter of the assemblage, his fear changed to
      anger, and he immediately attempted to regain what had been pilfered from
      him. But the monkey was not inclined to part with his spoil, and a
      struggle of a very comical kind ensued. Xit seized the monkey's paws, and
      tried to get back the chesnuts, while the latter, gibbering and grinning
      horribly, laid hold of the mannikin's shock head of hair, and after
      lugging him tremendously, tore up a large lock by the roots. Enraged by
      the pain, Xit tried to draw his sword, but finding it impossible, he
      grasped the beast by both ears, and despite its struggling, squealing, and
      attempts to bite, succeeded in keeping it at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      What might have been the result of the conflict it is impossible to say.
      But just as Xit's strength was failing, Hairun flew to his assistance, and
      partly by threats, partly by the application of a switch to its back,
      drove the monkey into a corner. Xit was highly complimented for his
      courage, and though he occasionally rubbed his head, these encomiums
      entirely reconciled him to the loss of his hair. Magog, who cherished some
      little resentment for his former tricks, laughed immoderately at the
      incident, and said, "My beard is already grown again, but it will be a
      long time before thy rough poll regains its accustomed appearance. Ha!
      ha!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, the meal was concluded, and it was followed by a plentiful
      supply of ale, hydromel, bragget, and wine. Nor did Peter Trusbut forget
      to slip the stone bottle of distilled water into Magog's hand,
      recommending him on no account to let Xit taste it&mdash;a suggestion
      scrupulously observed by the giant. His guests having passed a merry hour
      over their cups, Hairun proposed to conduct them over the menagerie, that
      they might see what condition the animals were in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposal was eagerly accepted, and providing torches, the bearward led
      them into a small court, communicating by a low arched door with the
      menagerie. It was then as now, (for the modern erection, which is still
      standing though wholly unused, followed the arrangement of the ancient
      structure, and indeed retains some of the old stone arches), a wide
      semicircular fabric, in which were contrived, at distances of a few feet
      apart, a number of arched cages, divided into two or more compartments,
      and secured by strong iron bars.

      A high embattled wall of the same form as the inner structure faced on the
      west a small moat, now filled up, which flowed round these outworks from
      the base of the Middle Tower to a fortification, now also removed, called,
      from its situation, the Lions' Gate, where it joined the larger moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the dens stood a wide semicircular gallery, defended by a low
      stone parapet, and approached by a flight of steps from the back. It was
      appropriated exclusively to the royal use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of maintaining a menagerie within the Tower, as an appendage to
      their state, was, in all probability derived by our monarchs, as has been
      previously intimated, from the circumstance of the Emperor Frederick
      having presented Henry the Third with three leopards, in allusion to his
      coat of arms, which animals were afterwards carefully kept within the
      fortress. Two orders from this sovereign to the sheriffs of London, in
      reference to a white bear, which formed part of his live stock, are
      preserved; the first, dated 1253, directing that fourpence a day (a
      considerable sum for the period) be allowed for its sustenance; and tho
      second, issued in the following year, commanding "that for the keeper of
      our white bear, lately sent us from Norway, and which is in our Tower of
      London, ye cause to be had one muzzle and one iron chain, to hold that
      bear without the water; and one long and strong cord to hold the same bear
      when fishing in the river of Thames." Other mandates relating to an
      elephant appear in the same reign, in one of which it is directed&mdash;"that
      ye cause without delay to be built at our Tower of London one house of
      forty feet long, and twenty feet deep, for our elephant; providing that it
      be so made and so strong, that when need be, it may be fit and necessary
      for other uses. And the cost shall be computed at the Exchequer." A fourth
      order appoints that the animal and his keeper shall be found with such
      necessaries "as they shall reasonably require." The royal menagerie was
      greatly increased by Edward the Third, who added to it, amongst other
      animals, a lion and lioness, a leopard, and two wild cats; and in the
      reign of Henry the Sixth the following provisions was made for the keeper:&mdash;"We
      of our special grace have granted to our beloved servant, Robert
      Mansfield, esquire, marshall of our hall, the office of keeper of the
      lions, with a certain place which hath been appointed anciently within our
      said Tower for them; to have and to occupy the same, by himself or by his
      sufficient deputy, for the term of his life, with the wages of sixpence
      per day for himself, and with the wages of sixpence per day for the
      maintenance of every lion or leopard now being in his custody, or that
      shall be in his custody hereafter." From this it will appear that no
      slight importance was attached to the office, which was continued until
      recent times, when the removal of the menagerie rendered it wholly
      unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dazzled by the lights, and infuriated with hunger, the savage denizens of
      the cages set up a most terrific roaring as the party entered the flagged
      space in front of them. Hairun, who was armed with a stout staff, laid
      about him in right earnest, and soon produced comparative tranquillity.
      Still, the din was almost deafening. The animals were numerous, and fine
      specimens of their kind. There were lions in all postures,&mdash;couchant,
      dormant, passant, and guardant; tigers, leopards, hyaenas, jackals,
      lynxes, and bears. Among the latter, an old brown bear, presented to Henry
      the Eighth by the Emperor Maximilian, and known by the name of the
      imperial donor, particularly attracted their attention, from its curious
      tricks. At last, after much solicitation from Dames Placida and Potentia,
      the bearward opened the door of the cage, and old Max issued forth. At
      first, he was all gentleness, sat upon his hind legs, and received the
      apples and biscuits given him like a lap-dog, when all at once, his master
      having stepped aside to quell a sudden disturbance which had arisen in one
      of the adjoining cages, he made a dart at Dame Placida, who was standing
      near him, and devouring the fruit and cakes she held in her hand at a
      mouthful, would have given her a formidable hug, if she had not saved
      herself by running into his cage, the door of which stood open. Here she
      would certainly have been caught, if her husband had not rushed to the
      entrance. Max warily eyed his new opponent, and uttered a menacing growl,
      but seemed to decline the attack. Dame Placida filled the cage with her
      shrieks, and alarmed by the cries, all the wild animals renewed their
      howling. Hairun would have flown to Magog's assistance, but the latter
      called to him in a voice of thunder to desist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will have no interference," he roared, "old Max and I understand each
      other perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      As if he comprehended what was said, the bear replied by a hoarse growl,
      and displayed his enormous fangs in a formidable manner. Dame Placida
      renewed her cries, and besought Ribald to come to her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay where you are," thundered Magog, "I will settle this matter in my
      own way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help! for mercy's sake, help!" shrieked Dame Placida,&mdash;"never mind
      him!&mdash;help! good Hairun&mdash;dear Ribald&mdash;help! or I shall be
      torn in pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, Ribald and Hairun would have obeyed. But they were
      prevented by Og and Gog, who began to sec through their brother's design.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave him alone," they cried, laughing loudly. "He is about to give his
      dame a lesson."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all?" replied Hairun. "Then he shall have no interruption from
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Barbarian!" cried Dame Placida, appealing to her husband. "Do you mean
      that I should be devoured! Oh! if ever I <i>do</i> get out, you shall
      bitterly repent your cruel conduct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never <i>shall</i> get out, unless you promise to amend your own
      conduct," rejoined Magog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will die sooner than make any such promise," replied Placida.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then," rejoined Magog, "I shall give free passage to Max."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he slightly moved his person, while the animal uttered another growl.
      The giants laughed loudly, and encouraged their brother to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make her promise, or let Max take his course," they shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear it not," answered Magog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monster!" shrieked Dame Placida, "you cannot mean this&mdash;help! help!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But no one stirred. And above the roaring of the animals and the angry
      growling of Max, which Magog had provoked with a sly kick or two, was
      heard the loud laughter of the gigantic brethren.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you two minutes to consider," said Magog. "If you do not resolve
      to amend in that time, I leave you to your fate.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he again goaded Max into a further exhibition of fury. Dame Placida
      became seriously alarmed, and her proud spirit began to give way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise," she uttered faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak up!" bellowed Magog. "I can't hear you for the noise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promise," replied Placida, in a loud and peevish voice. "That won't
      do," rejoined her husband. "Speak as you used to do before I married you,
      and let the others hear you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes," cried Og, drawing near with the rest, "we must all hear
      it, that we may be witnesses hereafter. You promise to amend your conduct,
      and let our brother live peaceably?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do&mdash;I do," replied Placida, in a penitential tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," replied Magog. And putting out his arm behind to his wife he
      covered her retreat, and then suddenly turning upon Max, kicked him into
      the cage, and fastened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much laughter among the male portion of the company ensued. But Dame
      Potentia looked rather grave, and privately intimated to her husband her
      desire, or rather command, that he should go home. As Peter Trusbut took
      his departure, he whispered to Hairun, "If ever you think of marrying, I
      advise you to take good care of old Max. I wish I could borrow him for a
      day or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have him, and welcome," returned the bearward, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you&mdash;thank you," answered the pantler, dejectedly. "Mine is a
      hopeless case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dame Placida appeared so much subdued, that at last Magog took compassion
      upon her, and led her away, observing to the bearward, "For my sake bestow
      a plentiful supper on Max. He has done me a good turn, and I would fain
      requite it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the party speedily followed their example, and as Xit took his
      leave, he remarked to his host, "Nothing but Magog's desire to terrify his
      dame prevented me from attacking Max. I am certain I could master him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say you so?" replied Hairun; "then you may have an opportunity of
      displaying your prowess before the queen tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will certainly avail myself of it," replied Xit. "Give him a good
      supper, and he will be in better condition for the fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the following day, Mary arrived at the Tower. She came by water,
      and was received at the landing-place by Sir Henry Bedingfeld, who
      conducted her with much ceremony to the palace, where a sumptuous banquet
      was prepared, at which the knight assisted as chief sewer, presenting each
      dish to the queen on his bended knee, and placing a silver ewer filled
      with rosewater, and a napkin, before her between the courses. Mary looked
      grave and thoughtful, nor could the liveliest sallies of De Noailles, who
      was one of the guests, call a smile to her lips. Renard, also, was
      present, and looked more gloomy than usual. The banquet ended, Sir Henry
      Bedingfeld approached, and laid a parchment before the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this, sir?" she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The warrant for the burning of Edward Underhill, the miscreant who
      attempted your highness's life," replied Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How!&mdash;burned! and I had pardoned him," exclaimed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has been delivered over by the council to the ecclesiastical
      authorities, and such is the sentence pronounced against him," returned
      the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary sighed, and attached her signature to the scroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hour of execution, and the place?" demanded Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow at midnight, on the Tower-green," replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, it being intimated to the queen that all was in readiness
      at the Lion's Tower, she arose and proceeded thither, attended by a large
      retinue of nobles and dames. On the way a momentary interruption occurred,
      and Simon Renard, who walked a few paces behind her, stepped forward, and
      whispered in her ear, "I beseech your highness to remain to-night in the
      Tower. I have somewhat of importance to communicate to you, which can be
      more safely revealed here than elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary bowed assent, and the train set forward. A large assemblage was
      collected within the area in front of the Lions' Tower, but a passage was
      kept dear for the royal party by two lines of halberdiers drawn up on
      either side. Og and Magog were stationed at the entrance, and
      reverentially doffed their caps as she passed. Mary graciously
      acknowledged the salute, and inquired from the elder giant what had become
      of his diminutive companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is within, an' please your majesty," replied Og, "waiting to signalize
      himself by a combat with a bear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" rejoined Mary smiling. "It is a hardy enterprise for so small a
      champion. However, large souls oft inhabit little bodies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness says rightly," observed Og. "But your illustrious father,
      to whom I have the honour to be indirectly related," and he inclined his
      person, "was wont to observe that he had rather have a large frame and
      small wit, than much wit and a puny person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father loved to look upon a <i>man</i>," replied Mary, "and better
      specimens of the race than thee and thy brethren he could not well meet
      with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are much beholden to your highness," replied Og; "and equally, if not
      more so, to your royal father. Whatever we can boast of strength and size
      is derived from him. Our mother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some other time," interrupted Mary, hastily passing on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I said aught to offend her highness?" asked Og of his brother, as
      soon as they wero alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not," returned Magog. "But you fetched the colour to her cheeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the steps, Mary tendered her hand to Sir Henry Bcdingfeld, and
      he assisted her to ascend. A temporary covering had been placed over the
      gallery, and the stone parapet was covered with the richest brocade, and
      velvet edged with gold fringe. The queen's chair was placed in the centre
      of the semicircle, and as soon as she was seated, Sir Henry Bcdingfeld
      stationed himself at her left hand, and waved his staff. The signal was
      immediately answered by a flourish of trumpets; and a stout, square-built
      man, with large features, an enormous bushy beard, a short bull throat,
      having a flat cap on his head, and a stout staff in his hand, issued from
      a side-door and made a profound obeisance. It was Hairun. His homage
      rendered, the bearward proceeded to unfasten the door of the central cage,
      in which a lion of the largest size was confined; and uttering a
      tremendous roar that shook the whole building, the kingly brute leaped
      forth. As soon as he had reached the ground, he glared furiously at his
      keeper, and seemed to meditate a spring. But the latter, who had never
      removed his eye from him, struck him a severe blow on the nose with his
      pole, and he instantly turned tail like a beaten hound, and fled howling
      to the further extremity of the area. Quickly pursuing him, Hairun seized
      him by the mane, and, in spite of his resistance, compelled him to arise,
      and bestriding him, rode him backwards and forwards for some time; until
      the lion, wearying of the performance, suddenly dislodged his rider, and
      sprang back to his den. This courageous action elicited great applause
      from the beholders, and the queen loudly expressed her approbation. It was
      followed by other feats equally daring, in which the bearward proved that
      he had attained as complete a mastery over the savage tribe as any
      lion-tamer of modern times. Possessed of prodigious personal strength, he
      was able to cope with any animal, while his knowledge of the habits of the
      beast rendered him perfectly fearless as to the result. He unloosed a
      couple of leopards, goaded them to the utmost pitch of fury, and then
      defended himself from their combined attack. A tiger proved a more serious
      opponent. Springing against him, he threw the bearward to the ground, and
      for a moment it appeared as if his destruction was inevitable. But the
      brute's advantage was only momentary. In this unfavourable position,
      Hairun seized him by the throat, and nearly strangling him with his gripe,
      pulled him down, and they rolled over each other. During the struggle,
      Hainin dealt his antagonist a few blows with his fist, which deprived him
      of his wind, and glad to retreat, he left the bearward master of the
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hairun immediately arose, and bowed to the queen, and, excepting a few
      scratches in the arms, and a gash in the cheek, from which the blood
      trickled down his beard, appeared none the worse for the contest. So
      little, indeed, did he care for it, that without tarrying to recover
      breath, he opened another cage and brought out a large hyæna, over whom he
      obtained an easy conquest. At last, having finished his performance to the
      queen's entire satisfaction, he stepped to a side-door, and introduced Gog
      and Xit. The latter was arrayed in his gayest habiliments, and strutting
      into the centre of the area with a mincing step, made a bow to the gallery
      that drew a smile to the royal lips, and addressing Hairun, called in a
      loud voice, "Bring forth Maximilian, the imperial bear, that I may combat
      with him before the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearward proceeded to the cage, and unfastening it, cried, "Come
      forth, old Max." And the bear obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit, meanwhile, flung his cap on the ground, and drawing his sword, put
      himself in a posture of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I stand by thee?" asked Gog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no account," replied Xit, in an offended tone, "I want-no assistance.
      I can vanquish him alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare thy adversary's life," observed Hairun, laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing," replied Xit, "the brave are ever merciful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," laughed Hairun, "I must give a like caution to Max." And feigning
      to whisper in the bear's ear, who was sitting on its hind legs, lolling
      out its tongue, and looking round in expectation of some eatables, he
      laughingly withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that Max paid no attention to him, Xit drew nearer, and stamping
      his foot furiously on the ground several times, made a lunge at him,
      screaming&mdash;"Sa-ha! sa-ha! sirrah,&mdash;to the combat!&mdash;to the
      combat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Max did not notice him, but kept his small red eyes fixed on the
      gallery, expecting that something would be thrown to him. Enraged at this
      contemptuous treatment of his defiance, Xit snatched up his cap, flung it
      in the bear's face, and finding even this insult prove ineffectual, began
      to prick him with the point of his sword, crying, "Rouse thee, craven
      beast! Defend thy life, or I will slay thee forthwith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus provoked, Max at length condescended to regard his opponent. He
      uttered a fierce growl, but would not perhaps have retaliated, if Xit had
      not persevered in his annoyances. Gesticulating and vociferating fiercely,
      the dwarf made a number of rapid passes, some of which took effect in his
      antagonist's hide. All at once, Max made a spring so suddenly, that Xit
      could not avoid it, struck down the sword, and catching the dwarf in his
      arms, hugged him to his bosom. All Xit's courage vanished in a breath. He
      screamed loudly for help, and kicked and struggled to free himself from
      the terrible grasp in which he was caught. But Max was not disposed to let
      him off so cheaply, and the poor dwarfs terror was excessive when he
      beheld those formidable jaws, and that terrible array of teeth ready to
      tear him in pieces. It had been all over with him, if Gog, who stood at a
      little distance, and narrowly watched the fray, thinking he had suffered
      enough, had not run to his assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0058" id="linkimage-0058"> </a>
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0322.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Grasping the bear's throat with his right hand, the giant forced back his
      head so as to prevent him from using his teeth, while planting his knee
      against the animal's side, he tore asunder its gripe with the other hand.
      Hairun, who was likewise flying to the rescue, seeing how matters stood,
      halted, and burst into a loud laugh. The next moment, Gog gave Max a
      buffet on the ears that laid him sprawling on his back, and Xit escaped
      from his clutches. As soon as the bear regained his legs, he uttered a low
      angry growl, and scrambled off to his cage. For a few seconds, Xit looked
      completely crest-fallen. By degrees, however, he recovered his confidence,
      and bowing to the gallery, said,&mdash;"I can scarcely with propriety lay
      claim to the victory, as if it had been for my friend Gog&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, thou art welcome to my share of it," interrupted the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If so," rejoined Xit, "I must be pronounced the conqueror, for Max has
      acknowledged himself vanquished by beating a retreat." As he spoke, the
      bear growled fiercely, and putting his head out of his cage, seemed
      disposed to renew the fight&mdash;a challenge so alarming to Xit, that he
      flew to Gog for protection, amid the laughter of the assemblage. Mary then
      arose, and giving a purse of gold to Sir Henry Bedingfeld, to be bestowed
      upon the bearward, took her departure for the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Xit was conversing with his friends, maintaining that he should have
      vanquished the bear, if Hairun had not most unfairly instructed the beast
      what to do, and offering to renew the combat on an early occasion,
      Lawrence Nightgall, accompanied by two halberdiers, entered the court, and
      approaching him, directed his companions to attach his person. Xit drew
      his sword, and called upon Gog to defend him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the meaning of this, master jailor?" demanded the giant, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is arrested by order of the council. There is the warrant," replied
      Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arrested!" exclaimed Xit. "For what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For conspiring against the queen," replied Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am innocent of the charge," replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That remains to be proved," replied Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no fears," rejoined Xit, recovering his composure,&mdash;"but if I
      must lose my head, like his grace of Northumberland, I will make a better
      figure on the scaffold. I shall be the first dwarf that ever perished by
      the axe. Farewell, Gog. Comfort thyself, I am innocent. Lead me away, thou
      caitiff jailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he folded his arms upon his breast, and preceded by Nightgall,
      marched at a slow and dignified pace between his guards.

    <h2>
      XX.&mdash;HOW EDWARD UNDERHILL WAS BURNT ON TOWER GREEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the policy
      of the Romish priesthood, at the commencement of Mary's reign, to win, by
      whatever means, as many converts as possible to their church. With this
      view, Gardiner, by the queen's desire, offered a free pardon to the
      Hot-Gospeller, provided he would publicly abjure his errors, and embrace
      the Catholic faith; well knowing, that as general attention had been drawn
      to his crime, and strong sympathy was excited on account of his doctrines,
      notwithstanding the heinous nature of his offence, among the Protestant
      party, that his recantation would be far more available to their cause
      than his execution. But the enthusiast rejected the offer with disdain.
      Worn down by suffering, crippled with torture, his spirit still burnt
      fiercely as ever. And the only answer that could be wrung from him by his
      tormentors was, that he lamented his design had failed, and rejoiced he
      should seal his faith with his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion, he was visited in his cell by Bonner, who desired that
      the heavy irons with which he was loaded should be removed, and a cup of
      wine given him. Underhill refused to taste the beverage, but Nightgall and
      Wolfytt, who were present, forced him to swallow it. A brief conference
      then took place between the bishop and the prisoner, wherein the former
      strove earnestly to persuade him to recant. But Underhill was so firm in
      his purpose, and so violent in his denunciations against his interrogator,
      that Bonner lost all patience, and cried, "If my words do not affright
      thee, thou vile traitor and pestilent heretic, yet shall the fire to which
      I will deliver thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There thou art mistaken, thou false teacher of a false doctrine,"
      rejoined Underhill sternly. "The fire may consume my body, but it hath no
      power over my mind, which shall remain as unscathed as the three children
      of Israel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, when they stood in the midst
      of the fiery furnace. For as the apostle saith&mdash;'The fire shall try
      every man's work what it is. If any man's work, that he hath builded upon,
      abide, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work burn, he shall suffer
      loss. But he shall be saved himself, nevertheless, yet as it were through
      fire.' Even so shall I, despite my manifold transgressions, be saved:
      while ye, idolatrous priests and prophets of Baal, shall be consumed in
      everlasting flames."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to,&mdash;go to, thou foolish boaster," retorted Bonner angrily; "a
      season will come when thou wilt bitterly lament thou hast turned aside the
      merciful intentions of thy judges."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said that the fire has no terrors for me," replied
      Underhill. "When the spirit has once asserted its superiority over the
      flesh, the body can feel no pain. Upon the rack&mdash;in that dreadful
      engine, which fixes the frame in such a posture that no limb or joint can
      move&mdash;I was at ease. And to prove that I have no sense of suffering,
      I will myself administer the torture."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, and raising with some difficulty his stiffened arm, he held his
      hand over the flame of a lamp that stood upon the table before him, until
      the veins shrunk and burst, and the sinews cracked. During this dreadful
      trial, his countenance underwent no change. And if Bonner had not
      withdrawn the lamp, he would have allowed the limb to be entirely
      consumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peradventure, thou wilt believe me now," he cried triumphantly; "and wilt
      understand that the Lord will so strengthen me with his holy spirit that I
      may be 'one of the number of those blessed, which, enduring to the end,
      shall reap a heavenly inheritance.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take him away," replied Bonner. "His blood be upon his own head. He is so
      blinded and besotted, that he does not perceive that his death will lead
      to damnation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, verily," rejoined Underhill, exultingly; "for as Saint Paul saith,
      There is no damnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, which walk not
      after the flesh, but after the spirit. Death, where is thy sting? Hell,
      where is thy victory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hence with the blasphemer," roared Bonner; "and spare him no torments,
      for he deserves the severest ye can inflict."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Underhill was removed, and the bishop's injunctions in respect
      to the torture literally fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brought to trial for the attempt upon the queen's life, he was found
      guilty, and received the royal pardon. Nothing could be elicited as to his
      having any associates or instigators to his crime. And the only matter
      that implicated another was the prayer for the restoration of Jane,
      written in a leaf of the bible found upon his person at the time of his
      seizure. But though he was pardoned by Mary, he did not escape. He was
      claimed as a heretic by Bonner; examined before the ecclesiastical
      commissioners; and adjudged to the stake. The warrant for his execution
      was signed, as above related, by the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night before this terrible sentence was carried into effect, he was
      robed in a loose dress of flame-coloured taffeta, and conveyed through the
      secret passages to Saint John's Chapel in the White Tower, which was
      brilliantly illuminated, and filled with a large assemblage. As he entered
      the sacred structure, a priest advanced with holy water, but he turned
      aside with a scornful look. Another, more officious, placed a consecrated
      wafer to his lips, but he spat it out; while a third forced a couple of
      tapers into his hands, which he was compelled to carry, in this way, he
      was led along the aisle by his guard, through the crowd of spectators who
      divided as he moved towards the altar, before which, as on the occasion of
      the Duke of Northumberland's reconciliation, Gardiner was seated upon the
      faldstool, with the mitre on his head. Priests and choristers were
      arranged on either side in their full habits. The aspect of the
      chancellor-bishop was stern and menacing, but the miserable enthusiast did
      not quail before it. On the contrary, he seemed inspired with new
      strength; and though he had with difficulty dragged his crippled limbs
      along the dark passages, he now stood firm and erect. His limbs were
      wasted, his cheeks hollow, his eyes deep sunken in their sockets, but
      flashing with vivid lustre. At a gesture from Gardiner, Nightgall and
      Wolfytt, who attended him, forced him upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Underhill, demanded the bishop, in a stern voice, "for the last
      time, I ask thee dost thou persist in thy impious and damnable heresies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I persist in my adherence to the Protestant faith, by which alone I can
      be saved," replied Underhill, firmly. "I deserve and desire death for
      having raised my hand against the queens life. But as her highness has
      been graciously pleased to extend her mercy towards me, if I suffer death
      it will be in the cause of the gospel. And I take all here present to
      witness that I am right willing to do so, certain that I shall obtain by
      such means the crown of everlasting life. I would suffer a thousand deaths&mdash;yea
      all the rackings, torments, crucifyings, and other persecutions endured by
      the martyrs of old, rather than deny Christ and his gospel, or defile my
      faith and conscience with the false worship of the Romish religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then perish in thy sins, unbeliever," replied Gardiner sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he arose, and taking off his mitre, the whole assemblage knelt down,
      while the terrible denunciation of the Catholic church against a heretic
      was solemnly pronounced. This done, mass was performed, hymns were
      chanted, and the prisoner was conducted to his cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brief remainder of his life was passed by Underhill in deep but silent
      devotion; for his jailors, who never left him, would not suffer him to
      pray aloud, or even to kneel; and strove, though vainly, to distract him,
      by singing ribald songs, plucking his beard and garments, and offering
      other interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place appointed as the scene of his last earthly suffering was a
      square patch of ground, marked by a border of white flint stones, then,
      and even now, totally destitute of herbage, in front of Saint Peter's
      Chapel on the Green, where the scaffold for those executed within the
      Tower was ordinarily erected, and where Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard
      were beheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this spot a strong stake was driven deeply into the ground, and at a
      little distance from it was piled a large stack of fagots. An iron ring
      was fixed to the centre of the stake, and to the ring was attached a broad
      iron girdle, destined to encircle the body of the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      As night set in, a large band of halberdiers marched into the green, and
      stationed themselves round the stake. Long before this, sombre groups had
      gathered together at various points, and eyed the proceedings in moody
      silence. None of the curiosity&mdash;none of the excitement ordinarily
      manifested upon such occasions&mdash;was now exhibited. Underhills crime
      had checked the strong tide of sympathy which would otherwise have run in
      his favour. Still, as he had been pardoned by the queen, and was condemned
      for his religious opinions only, deep commiseration was felt for him. It
      was not, however, for him that the assemblage looked grave, but for
      themselves. Most of them were of the Reformed faith, and they argued&mdash;and
      with reason,&mdash;that this was only the commencement of a season of
      trouble; and that the next victim might be one of their own family. With
      such sentiments, it is not to be wondered at, that they looked on sternly
      and suspiciously, and with the strongest disposition&mdash;though it was
      not manifested, otherwise than by looks&mdash;to interrupt the
      proceedings. As it grew dark, and faces could no longer be discerned, loud
      murmurings arose, and it was deemed expedient to double the guard, and to
      place in custody some of the most clamorous. By this means, all
      disposition to tumult was checked, and profound silence ensued. Meanwhile,
      numbers continued to flock thither, until, long before the appointed hour
      arrived, the whole area from the lieutenant's lodgings to Saint Peters
      Chapel was densely thronged.

    </h5>
    <p>
      As the bell ceased tolling the hour of midnight, a lugubrious procession
      slowly issued from beneath the gloomy archway of the Coalharbour Gate.
      First came four yeomen of the guard walking two and two, and bearing
      banners of black silk, displaying large white crosses. Then twelve deacons
      in the same order, in robes of black silk and flat caps, each carrying a
      long lighted wax taper. Then a priest's assistant, in a white surplice,
      with a red cross in front, bareheaded, and swinging a large bell heavily
      to and fro. Then two young priests, likewise bareheaded, and in white
      surplices, each holding a lighted taper in a massive silver candlestick.
      Then an old priest with the mitre. Then two chantry-priests in their robes
      singing the Miserere. Then four Carmelite monks, each with a large rosary
      hanging from his wrist, supporting a richly gilt square canopy, decorated
      at each corner with a sculptured cross, beneath which walked Bonner, in
      his scarlet chimere and white rochet. Then came Feckenham and other
      prelates, followed by two more chantry-priests singing the same doleful
      hymn as their predecessors. Then came a long train of halberdiers. Then
      the prisoner, clothed in sackcloth and bare-footed, walking between two
      friars of the lowly order of Saint Francis, who besought him, in piteous
      tones, to repent ere it was too late. And lastly, the rear was brought up
      by a company of archers of the queen's body guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the procession had formed in the order it arrived round the
      place of execution, the prisoner was brought forward by the two friars,
      who for the last time earnestly exhorted him to recant, and save his soul
      alive. But he pushed them from him, saying, "Get hence ye popish wolves!
      ye raveners of Christ's faithful flock! Back to the idolatrous Antichrist
      of Rome who sent ye hither. I will have none of your detestable doctrines.
      Get hence, I say, and trouble me no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the friars drew back, he would have addressed the assemblage. But a
      halberdier, by Bonner's command, thrust a pike into his mouth and silenced
      him. A wild and uncouth figure, with strong but clumsily-formed limbs,
      coarse repulsive features, lighted up by a savage smile, now stepped
      forward. It was Wolfytt, the sworn tormentor. He was attired in a jerkin
      and hose of tawny leather. His arms and chest were bare, and covered with
      a thick pile of red hair. His ragged locks and beard, of the same
      disgusting colour, added to his hideous and revolting appearance. He was
      armed with a long iron pitchfork, and had a large hammer and a pair of
      pincers stuck in his girdle. Behind him came Mauger and Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep and awful silence now prevailed throughout the concourse. Not a
      breath was drawn, and every eye was bent upon the victim. He was seized
      and stripped by Mauger and Wolfytt, the latter of whom dragged him to the
      stake, which the poor zealot reverently kissed as he reached it, placed
      the iron girdle round his waist, and riveted it to the post. In this
      position, Underhill cried with a loud voice, "God preserve Queen Jane! and
      speedily restore her to the throne, that she may deliver this unhappy
      realm from the popish idolaters who would utterly subvert it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Several voices cried "Amen!" and Wolfytt, who was nailing the girdle at
      the time, commanded him to keep silence, and enforced the order by
      striking him a severe blow on the temples with the hammer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might have spared me that, friend," observed Underhill, meekly. And
      he then added, in a lower tone, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am
      weak! O Lord heal me, for all my bones are vexed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      While the fagots were heaped around him by Mauger and Nightgall, he
      continued to pray fervently; and when all was made ready, he cried, "Dear
      Father, I beseech thee to give once more to this realm the blessing of thy
      word, with godly peace. Purge and purify me by this fire in Christ's death
      and passion through thy spirit, that I may be an acceptable burnt-offering
      in thy sight. Farewell, dear friends. Pray for me, and pray with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Nightgall seized a torch and applied it to the fagots. His
      example was imitated by Mauger and Wolfytt, and the pile was speedily
      kindled. The dry wood crackled, and the smoke rose in thick volumes. the
      flames then burst forth, and burning fast and fiercely, cast a lurid light
      upon the countenances of the spectators, upon the windows of Saint Peter's
      chapel, and upon the grey walls of the White Tower. As yet, the fire had
      not reached the victim; the wind blowing strongly from the west, carried
      it aside. But in a few seconds it gained sufficient ascendancy, and his
      sufferings commenced. For a short space, he endured them without a groan.
      But as the flames mounted, notwithstanding all his efforts, the sharpness
      of the torment overcame him. Placing his hands behind his neck, he made
      desperate attempts to draw himself further up the stake, out of the reach
      of the devouring element. But the iron girdle effectually restrained him.
      He then lost all command of himself; and his eyes starting from their
      sockets&mdash;his convulsed features&mdash;his erected hair, and writhing
      frame&mdash;proclaimed the extremity of his agony. He sought relief by
      adding to his own torture. Crossing his hands upon his breast, and
      grasping either shoulder, he plunged his nails deeply into the flesh. It
      was a horrible sight, and a shuddering groan burst from the assemblage.
      Fresh fagots were added by Nightgall and his companions, who moved around
      the pyre like fiends engaged in some impious rite. The flames again arose
      brightly and fiercely. By this time, the lower limbs were entirely
      consumed; and throwing back his head, and uttering a loud and lamentable
      yell which was heard all over the fortress, the wretched victim gave up
      the ghost. A deep and mournful silence succeeded this fearful cry. It
      found an heco in every breast.

    <h2>
      XXI.&mdash;HOW LORD GUILFORD DUDLEY AND LADY JANE WERE ARRAIGNED AND
      ATTAINTED OF HIGH TREASON; AND HOW THEY WERE PARDONED BY QUEEN MARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ore than three
      months had now been passed by Jane in solitary confinement in the Brick
      Tower. Long as was the interval, it appeared brief to her&mdash;her whole
      time being devoted to intense mental application, or to prayer. She lived
      only in her books; and addressed herself with such ardour to her studies,
      that her thoughts were completely abstracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, indeed, in spite of all her efforts, recollections of the past
      would obtrude themselves upon her&mdash;visions of earlier days and of the
      events and scenes connected with them would rise before her. She thought
      of Bradgate and its green retreats,&mdash;of her beloved preceptor, Roger
      Ascham,&mdash;of the delight with which she had become acquainted, through
      him, with the poetry, the philosophy, the drama of the ancient world. She
      recalled their long conversations, in which he had painted to her the
      vanities and vexations of the world, and the incomparable charms of a life
      of retirement and meditation, and she now felt the truth of his
      assertions. Had it been permitted her to pass her quiet and blameless
      career in that tranquil place, how happy would she have been! And yet she
      did not repine at her lot, but rather rejoiced at it. "Whatever my own
      sufferings may be," she murmured&mdash;"however severely I may be
      chastened, I yet feel I shall not endure in vain, but that others will
      profit by my example. If heaven will vouchsafe me grace and power, not one
      action of my life but shall redound to the honour of the faith I profess."
    </p>
    <p>
      One thought she ever checked, feeling that the emotions it excited,
      threatened to shake her constancy. This was the idea of her husband; and
      whenever it arose she soothed the pang it occasioned by earnest prayer.
      The reflection that he was now as firm an adherent to the tenets of the
      gospel as herself, and that by her own resolution she had wrought this
      beneficial change in him, cheered and animated her, and almost reconciled
      her to her separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      So fully prepared did she now feel for the worst shock of fate, that the
      only thing she regretted was that she was not speedily brought to trial.
      But she repressed even this desire as inconsistent with her duty, and
      unworthy of her high and holy calling. "My part is submission," she
      murmured, "and whether my term of life is long or short, it becomes me to
      feel and act in like manner. Whenever I am called upon, I am ready,&mdash;certain,
      if I live devoutly, to attain everlasting happiness, and rejoin my husband
      where he will never be taken from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, she thoroughly reconciled herself to her situation. And
      though in her dreams old scenes and faces would often revisit her&mdash;though
      her husband's image constantly haunted her&mdash;and on waking her pillow
      was bedewed with her tears&mdash;still, she maintained her cheerfulness,
      and by never allowing one moment to pass unemployed, drove away all
      distressing thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so her husband. Immured in the Beauchamp Tower, he bore his
      confinement with great external fortitude; but his bosom was a prey to
      vain regrets and ambitious hopes. Inheriting, as has before been observed,
      the soaring aspirations of his father, but without his genius or daring,
      his mind was continually dwelling upon the glittering bauble he had lost,
      and upon the means of regaining it. Far from being warned by the duke's
      fate,&mdash;far from considering the fearful jeopardy in which he himself
      stood&mdash;he was ever looking forward to the possibility of escape, and
      to the chance of reinstating himself in his lost position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely attached to Jane, he desired to be restored to her rather from
      the feeling which had led him to seek her hand&mdash;namely, a desire to
      use her as a means of aggrandizement,&mdash;than from any deep regret at
      the loss of her society. Not that misfortune had lessened his attachment,
      but that his ruling passion was ambition, which no reverse could quench,
      no change subdue. "He who has once nearly grasped a sceptre can never lose
      all thoughts of it," he exclaimed to himself. "I may perish&mdash;but
      while I live I shall indulge the hope of being king of England. And if I
      should ever obtain my liberty, I will never rest till I have won back the
      crown. Jane's name shall be my watchword&mdash;the Protestant cause my
      battle-cry; and if the victory is mine, she shall share my throne, but
      not, as heretofore, occupy it alone. Had I been king, this would never
      have happened. But my father's ambition ruined all. He aimed at the throne
      himself, and used me as his stepping-stone. Well, he has paid the penalty
      of his rashness, and I may perchance share his fate. Yet what if I do?
      Better die on the scaffold, than linger out a long inglorious life. Oh!
      that I could make one effort more! If I failed I would lay my head upon
      the block without a murmur."
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>long</i> delay that occurred before his trial encouraged his hopes,
      and a secret communication made to him by the Duke of Suffolk, who had
      leave to visit him, that a plot was in agitation to restore Jane to the
      throne, so raised his expectations, that he began to feel little
      apprehension for the future, confident that ere long the opportunity he
      sighed for would present itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since Jane's conference with Gardiner, Dudley had resisted all
      overtures from the Romish priesthood to win him over to their religion,
      and if his own feelings had not prompted him to this course, policy would
      have now dictated it. Slight as was the information he was able to obtain,
      he yet gathered that Mary's determination to restore the Catholic religion
      was making her many enemies, and giving new spirits to her opponents. And
      when he found, from the communication of De Noailles, that a plot, having
      for its basis the preservation of the Reformed religion, now menaced by
      the proposed alliance with Spain, was being formed, he became confirmed in
      his opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not deemed prudent by the conspirators to attempt any communication
      with Jane. They doubted much whether she could be prevailed upon to join
      them;&mdash;whether she might not even consider it her duty to reveal it;&mdash;and
      they thought there would be ample time to make it known to her when the
      season for outbreak arrived. Jane's partisans consisted only of her
      father, her uncle, and ostensibly Do Noailles, who craftily held out hopes
      to Suffolk and his brother to secure their zealous co-operation. In
      reality, the wily Frenchman favoured Courtenay and Elizabeth, But he
      scarcely cared which side obtained the mastery, provided he thwarted his
      adversary, Simon Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the early part of her imprisonment, Jane's solitude was disturbed
      by Feckenham, who, not content with his own discomfiture and that of his
      superiors, Gardiner and Bonner, returned again and again to the charge,
      but with no better success than before. Worsted in every encounter, he
      became, at length, convinced of the futility of the attempt, and abandoned
      it in despair. At first, Jane regarded his visits as a species of
      persecution, and a waste of the few precious hours allowed her, which
      might be far more profitably employed than in controversy. But when they
      ceased altogether, she almost regretted their discontinuance, as the
      discussions had led her to examine her own creed more closely than she
      otherwise might have done; and the success she invariably met with,
      inspired her with new ardour and zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus time glided on. Her spirits were always equable; her looks serene;
      and her health, so far from being affected by her captivity, appeared
      improved. One change requires to be noticed. It was remarked by her jailor
      that when first brought to the Brick Tower, she looked younger than her
      age, which was scarcely seventeen; but that ere a month had elapsed, she
      seemed like a matured woman. A striking alteration had, indeed, taken
      place in her appearance. Her countenance was grave, but so benignant, that
      its gravity had no displeasing effect. Her complexion was pale but clear,&mdash;so
      clear that the course of every azure vein could be traced through the
      wax-like skin. But that which imparted the almost <i>angelic</i> character
      to her features, was their expression of perfect purity, unalloyed by any
      taint of earth. What with her devotional observances, and her intellectual
      employments, the mind had completely asserted its dominion over the body;
      and her seraphic looks and beauty almost realized the Catholic notion of a
      saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had so won upon her jailor by her extraordinary piety, and by her
      gentleness and resignation, that he could scarcely offer her sufficient
      attention. He procured her such books as she desired&mdash;her sole
      request; and never approached her but with the profoundest reverence. From
      him she learned the fate of Edward Underhill, and during the dreadful
      sufferings of the miserable enthusiast, when the flames that were
      consuming him lighted up her prison-chamber, and his last wild shriek rang
      in her ears, her lips were employed in pouring forth the most earnest
      supplications for his release.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a terrible moment to Jane; and the wretched sufferer at the stake
      scarcely endured more anguish. Like many others, she saw in his fate a
      prelude of the storm that was to follow; and passed the whole of the night
      in prayer, that the danger might be averted. She prayed also, earnestly
      and sincerely, that a like death might be hers, if it would prove
      beneficial to her faith, and prevent further persecution.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, shortly after this event, the jailor made his appearance at an
      unwonted hour, and throwing himself at her feet, informed her that after a
      severe struggle with himself, he was determined to liberate her; and that
      he would not only throw open her prison-door that night, but would find
      means to set her free from the Tower. When he concluded, Jane, who had
      listened to his proposal with extreme surprise, at once, though with the
      utmost thankfulness, declined it. "You would break <i>your</i> trust, and
      I <i>mine</i>," she observed, "were I to accept your offer. But it would
      be useless. Whither should I fly&mdash;what should I do were I at large?
      No, friend, I cannot for a moment indulge the thought. If that door should
      be opened to me, I would proceed to the queen's presence, and beseech her
      highness to bring me to speedy trial. That is all the favour I deserve, or
      desire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, madam," replied the jailor, in accents of deep disappointment,
      "since I may not have my wish and set you free, I will at once resign my
      post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, do not so, I beseech you, good friend," returned Jane, "that were to
      do me an unkindness, which I am sure you would willingly avoid, by
      exposing me to the harsh treatment of some one less friendly-disposed
      towards me than yourself, from whom I have always experienced compassion
      and attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Foul befal me if I did not show you such, sweet lady!" cried the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your nature is kindly, sir," pursued Jane; "and as I must needs continue
      a captive, so I pray you show your regard by continuing my jailor. It
      gladdens me to think I have a friend so near."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you will, madam," rejoined the man, sorrowfully. "Yet I beseech you,
      pause ere you reject my offer. An opportunity of escape now presents
      itself, which may never occur again. If you will consent to fly, I will
      attend you, and act as your faithful follower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think me not insensible to your devotion, good friend, if I once more
      decline it," returned Jane, in a tone that showed that her resolution was
      taken. "I cannot fly&mdash;I have ties that bind me more securely than
      those strong walls and grated windows. Were the queen to give me the range
      of the fortress&mdash;nay, of the city without it, I should consider
      myself equally her captive. No, worthy friend, we must remain as we are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing remonstrance was in vain, the man, ashamed of the emotion he could
      neither control nor conceal, silently withdrew. The subject was never
      renewed, and though he acted with every consideration towards his
      illustrious captive, he did not relax in any of his duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full three months having elapsed since Jane's confinement commenced, on
      the first of November her jailor informed her that her trial would take
      place in Guildhall on the day but one following. To his inquiry whether
      she desired to make any preparations, she answered in the negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The offence I have committed," she said, "is known to all. I shall not
      seek to palliate it. Justice will take its course. Will my husband be
      tried with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly, madam," replied the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I be permitted to confer with him beforehand?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I grieve to say, madam, that the queen's orders are to the contrary."
      returned the jailor. "You will not meet him till you are placed at the bar
      before your judges."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since it may not be, I must resign myself contentedly to her majesty's
      decrees. Leave me, sir. Thoughts press upon me so painfully that I would
      fain be alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The queen's confessor is without, madam. He bade me say he would speak
      with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He uses strange ceremony, methinks," replied Jane. "He would formerly
      enter my prison without saying, By your leave: but since he allows me a
      choice in the matter, I shall not hesitate to decline his visit. If I may
      not confer with my husband, there is none other whom I desire to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he is the bearer of a message from her majesty," urged the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he is resolved to see me, I cannot prevent it," replied Jane. "But if
      I have the power to hinder his coming, he shall not do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will communicate your wish to him, madam," replied the jailor,
      retiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he told Feckenham that his charge was in no mood to listen to
      him, and the confessor departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third of November, the day appointed for Jane's trial, as well as for
      that of her husband, and of Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, was
      characterized by unusual gloom, even for the season. A dense fog arose
      from the river and spread itself over the ramparts, the summits of which
      could scarcely be discerned by those beneath them. The sentinels pacing to
      and fro looked like phantoms, and the whole fortress was speedily
      enveloped in a tawny-coloured vapour. Jane had arrayed herself betimes,
      and sat in expectation of the summons with a book before her, but it
      became so dark that she was compelled to lay it aside. The tramp of armed
      men in front of the building in which she was lodged, and other sounds
      that reached her, convinced her that some of the prisoners were being led
      forth; but she had to wait long before her own turn came. She thought more&mdash;much
      more&mdash;of beholding her husband, than of the result of the trial, and
      her heart throbbed as any chance footstep reached her ear, from the idea
      that it might be his.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after this, the door of her chamber was unbarred, and two officers
      of the guard in corslets and steel caps appeared and commanded her to
      follow them. Without a moment's hesitation she arose, and was about to
      pass through the door when the jailor prostrated himself before her, and
      pressing the hand she kindly extended to him to his lips, expressed, in
      faltering tones, a hope that she might not be brought back to his custody.
      Jane shook her head, smiled faintly, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Issuing from the structure, she found a large band of halberdiers drawn
      out to escort her. One stern figure arrested her attention, and recalled
      the mysterious terrors she had formerly experienced. This was Nightgall,
      who by Renard's influence had been raised to the post of gentleman-jailor.
      He carried the fatal axe,&mdash;its handle supported by a leathern pouch
      passed over his shoulders. The edge was turned from her, as was the custom
      on proceeding to trial. A shudder passed over her frame as her eye fell on
      the implement of death, connected as it was with her former alarms; but
      she gave no further sign of trepidation, and took the place assigned her
      by the officers. The train was then put in motion, and proceeded at a slow
      pace past the White Towner, down the descent leading to the Bloody Tower.
      Nightgall marched a few paces before her, and Jane, though she strove to
      reason herself out of her fears, could not repress a certain misgiving at
      his propinquity.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      The gateway of the Bloody Tower, through which the advanced guard was now
      passing, is perhaps one of the most striking remnants of ancient
      architecture to be met with in the fortress. Its dark and gloomy archway,
      bristling with the iron teeth of the portcullis, and resembling some huge
      ravenous monster, with jaws wide-opened to devour its prey, well accords
      with its ill-omened name, derived, as before stated, from the structure
      above it being the supposed scene of the murder of the youthful princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Erected in the reign of Edward the Third, this gateway is upwards of
      thirty feet in length, and fifteen in width. It has a vaulted roof,
      supported by groined arches, and embellished with moulded tracery of great
      beauty. At the period of this chronicle, it was defended at either
      extremity by a massive oak portal, strengthened by plates of iron and
      broad-headed nails, and a huge portcullis. Of these defences those at the
      south are still left. On the eastern side, concealed by the leaf of the
      gate when opened, is an arched doorway, communicating with a flight of
      spiral stone steps leading to the chambers above, in which is a machine
      for working the portcullis.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Jane had reached the centre of the arch, when the gate was
      suddenly pushed aside, and Feckenham stepped from behind it. On his
      appearance, word was given by the two captains, who marched with their
      drawn swords in hand on either side of the prisoner, to the train to halt.
      The command was instantly obeyed. Nightgall paused a few feet in advance
      of Jane, and grasping his fatal weapon, threw a stealthy glance over his
      left shoulder to ascertain the cause of the interruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you, reverend sir?" said Jane, halting with the others, and
      addressing Feckenham, who advanced towards her, holding in his hand a
      piece of parchment to which a large seal was attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would save you, daughter," replied the confessor. "I here bring you the
      queen's pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it unconditional, reverend sir?" demanded Jane, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sole condition annexed to it is your reconciliation with the church
      of Rome," replied Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I at once reject it," rejoined Jane, firmly. "I have already told
      you I should prefer death a thousand-fold to any violation of my
      conscience; and neither persuasion nor force shall compel me to embrace a
      religion opposed to the gospel of our Saviour, and which, in common with
      all his true disciples, I hold in utter abhorrence. I take all here to
      witness that such are my sentiments&mdash;that I am an earnest and
      zealous, though unworthy member of the Protestant church&mdash;and that I
      am fully prepared to seal my faith with my blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight murmur of approbation arose from the guard, which, however, was
      instantly checked by the officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I likewise take all here to witness," rejoined Feckenham, in a loud
      voice, "that a full and free pardon is offered you by our gracious queen,
      whom you have so grievously offended, that no one except a princess of her
      tender and compassionate nature would have overlooked it; coupled only
      with a condition which it is her assured belief will conduce as much to
      your eternal welfare as to your temporal. It has been made a reproach to
      our church by its enemies, that it seeks to win converts by severity and
      restraint. That the charge is unfounded her highness's present merciful
      conduct proves. We seek to save the souls of our opponents, however
      endangered by heresy, alive; and our first attempts are ever gentle. If
      these fail, and we are compelled to have recourse to harsher measures, is
      it our fault, or the fault of those who resist us? Thus, in your own case,
      madam&mdash;here, on the way to a trial the issue of which all can
      foresee, the arm of mercy is stretched out to you and to your husband, on
      a condition which, if you were not benighted in error, you would recognize
      as an additional grace,&mdash;and yet you turn it aside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sum of her majesty's mercy is this," replied Jane; "she would kill my
      soul to preserve my body. I care not for the latter, but I regard the
      former. Were I to embrace your faith, I should renounce all hopes of
      heaven. Are you answered, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," replied Feckenham. "But oh! madam," he added, falling at her feet;
      "believe not that I urge you to compliance from any unworthy motive. My
      zeal for your salvation is hearty and sincere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it not, sir," rejoined Jane. "And I thank you for your
      solicitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anger not the queen by a refusal," proceeded Feckenham:&mdash;"anger not
      heaven, whose minister I am, by a blind and obstinate rejection of the
      truth, but secure the favour of both your earthly and your celestial judge
      by compliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should indeed anger heaven were I to listen to you further," replied
      Jane. "Gentlemen," she added, turning to the officers, "I pray you
      proceed. The tribunal to which you are about to conduct me waits for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Feckenham arose, and would have given utterance to the denunciation that
      rose to his lips, had not Jane's gentle look prevented him. Bowing his
      head upon his breast, he withdrew, while the procession proceeded on its
      course, in the same order as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the bulwark gate, Jane was placed in a litter, stationed there
      for her reception, and conveyed through vast crowds of spectators, who,
      however, were unable to obtain even a glimpse of her, to Guildhall, where
      she was immediately brought before her judges. The sight of her husband
      standing at the bar, guarded by two halberdiers, well nigh overpowered
      her; but she was immediately re-assured by his calm, collected, and even
      haughty demeanour. He cast a single glance of the deepest affection at
      her, and then fixed his gaze upon the Marquis of Winchester, high
      treasurer of the realm, who officiated as chief judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left of Lord Guilford Dudley, on a lower platform, stood his
      faithful esquire, Cuthbert Cholmondeley, charged with abetting him in his
      treasonable practices. A vacant place on this side of her husband was
      allotted to Jane. Cranmer, having already been tried and attainted, was
      removed. The proceedings were soon ended, for the arraigned parties
      confessed their indictments, and judgment was pronounced upon them. Before
      they were removed, Lord Guilford turned to his consort, and said in a low
      voice&mdash;"Be of good cheer, Jane. No ill will befal you. Our judges
      will speedily take our places."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane looked at him for a moment, as if she did not comprehend his meaning,
      and then replied in the same tone&mdash;"I only required to see you so
      resigned to your fate, my dear lord, to make me wholly indifferent to
      mine. May we mount the scaffold together with as much firmness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall mount the throne together&mdash;not the scaffold, Jane,"
      rejoined Dudley, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Jane, perceiving from his speech that he meditated some
      new project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further discourse was not, however, allowed her, for at this moment she
      was separated from her husband by the halberdiers, who led her to the
      litter in which she was carried back to the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to herself within her prison-chamber, she revolved Dudley's
      mysterious words; and though she could not divine their precise import,
      she felt satisfied that he cherished some hope of replacing her on the
      throne. So far from this conjecture affording her comfort, it deeply
      distressed her&mdash;and for the first time for a long period her
      constancy was shaken. When her jailor visited her, he found her in the
      deepest affliction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! madam," he observed, in a tone of great commiseration, "I have
      heard the result of your trial, but the queen may yet show you
      compassion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not for myself I lament," returned Jane, raising her head, and
      drying her tears, "but for my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her majesty's clemency may be extended towards him likewise," remarked
      the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," returned Jane, "we have both offended her too deeply for
      forgiveness, and justice requires that we should expiate our offence with
      our lives. But you mistake me, friend. It is not because my husband is
      condemned as a traitor, that I grieve; but because he still nourishes vain
      and aspiring thoughts. I will trust you, knowing that you are worthy of
      confidence. If you can find means of communicating with Lord Guilford
      Dudley for one moment, tell him I entreat him to abandon all hopes of
      escape, or of restoration to his fallen state, and earnestly implore him
      to think only of that everlasting kingdom which we shall soon inherit
      together. Will you do this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly, madam, if I can accomplish it with safety," replied the
      jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Add also," pursued Jane, "that if Mary would resign her throne to me, I
      would not ascend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not fail, madam," rejoined the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he was about to depart, steps were heard on the staircase, and Sir
      Henry Bedingfeld, attended by a couple of halberdiers, entered the
      chamber. He held a scroll of parchment in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the bearer of my death-warrant, I perceive, sir," said Jane,
      rising at his approach, but without displaying any emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, madam," returned Sir Henry, kindly, "it rejoices me to
      say that I am a bearer of her majesty's pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clogged by the condition of my becoming a Catholic, I presume?" rejoined
      Jane, disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clogged by no condition," replied Bedingfeld, "except that of your living
      in retirement."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane could scarcely credit her senses, and she looked so bewildered that
      the knight repeated what he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my husband?" demanded Jane, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He too is free," replied Bedingfeld; "and on the same terms as yourself.
      You are both at liberty to quit the Tower as soon as you think proper.
      Lord Guilford Dudley has already been apprised of her highness's clemency,
      and will join you here in a few' minutes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane heard no more. The sudden revulsion of feeling produced by this
      joyful intelligence, was too much for her; and uttering a faint cry, she
      sank senseless into the arms of the old knight.

      XXII.&mdash;OF JANE'S RETURN TO SION HOUSE; AND OF HER ENDEAVOURS TO
      DISSUADE HER HUSBAND FROM JOINING THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST QUEEN MARY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat night Lord
      Guilford Dudley and Jane, attended by Cholmondeley, who was included in
      the pardon, left the Tower, and repaired to Sion House. On finding herself
      once more restored to freedom, and an inmate of the house she loved so
      well, Jane was completely prostrated. Joy was more difficult to bear than
      affliction; and the firmness that had sustained her throughout her
      severest trials now altogether forsook her. But a few days brought back
      her calmness, and she poured forth her heartfelt thanks to that beneficent
      Being, who had restored her to so much felicity. Measureless content
      seemed hers, and as she traversed the long galleries and halls of the
      ancient mansion&mdash;as she wandered through its garden walks,&mdash;or
      by the river's side&mdash;she felt that even in her proudest moment she
      had never known a tithe of the happiness she now experienced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day after day flew rapidly by, and pursuing nearly the same course she had
      adopted in prison, she never allowed an hour to pass that was not
      profitably employed. But she observed with concern that her husband did
      not share her happiness. He grew moody and discontented, and became far
      more reserved than she had heretofore known him. Shunning her society, he
      secluded himself in his chamber, to which he admitted no one but
      Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conduct Jane attributed in some degree to the effect produced upon
      his spirits by the reverse of fortune he had sustained, and by his long
      imprisonment. But she could not help fearing, though he did not confide
      the secrets of his bosom to her, that he still cherished the project he
      had darkly hinted at. She was confirmed in this opinion by the frequent
      visits of her father, who like her husband, had an anxious look, and by
      other guests who arrived at nightfall, and departed as secretly as they
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as this conviction seized her, she determined, at the hazard of
      incurring his displeasure, to speak to her husband on the subject; and
      accordingly, one day, when he entered her room with a moodier brow than
      usual, she remarked, "I have observed with much uneasiness, dear Dudley,
      that ever since our release from imprisonment, a gradually-increasing
      gloom has taken possession of you. You shun my regards, and avoid my
      society,&mdash;nay, you do not even converse with me, unless I wring a few
      reluctant answers from you. To what must I attribute this change?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To anything but want of affection for you, dear Jane," replied Dudley,
      with a melancholy smile, while he fondly pressed her hand. "You had once
      secrets from me, it is my turn to retaliate, and be mysterious towards
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not suppose me influenced by idle curiosity if I entreat to be
      admitted to your confidence, my dear lord," replied Jane. "Seeing you thus
      oppressed with care, and knowing how much relief is afforded by sharing
      the burthen with another, I urge you, for your own sake, to impart the
      cause of your anxiety to me. If I cannot give you counsel, I can
      sympathy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley shook his head, and made a slight effort to change the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not be turned from my purpose," persisted Jane; "I am the truest
      friend you have on earth, and deserve to be trusted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>would</i> trust you, Jane, if I dared," replied Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dared!" she echoed. "What is there that a husband dares not confide to
      his wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this instance much," answered Dudley; "nor can I tell you what
      occasions the gloom you have noticed, until I have your plighted word that
      you will not reveal aught I may say to you. And further, that you will act
      according to my wishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley," returned Jane gravely, "your demand convinces me that my
      suspicions are correct. What need of binding me to secrecy, and exacting
      my obedience, unless you are acting wrongfully, and desire me to do so
      likewise? Shall I tell why you fear I should divulge your secret&mdash;why
      you are apprehensive I should hesitate to obey your commands? You are
      plotting against the queen, and dread I should interfere with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no such fears," replied Dudley, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you own that I am right?" cried Jane, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are so far right," replied Dudley, "that I am resolved to depose
      Mary, and restore you to the throne, of which she has unjustly deprived
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unjustly, Dudley, for she is the rightful queen, and I was an
      usurper," replied Jane. "But oh! my dear, dear lord, can you have the
      ingratitude&mdash;for I will use no harsher term, to requite her clemency
      thus?" *
    </p>
    <p>
      "I owe her no thanks," replied Dudley, fiercely. "I have solicited no
      grace from her, and if she has pardoned me, it was of her own free will.
      It is part of her present policy to affect the merciful. But she showed no
      mercy towards my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does not your present conduct, dear Dudley, prove how necessary it is
      for princes, who would preserve their government undisturbed, to shut
      their hearts to compassion?" returned Jane. "You will fail in this
      enterprise if you proceed in it. And even I, who love you most, and am
      most earnest for your happiness and honour, do not desire it to succeed.
      It is based upon injustice, and will have no support from the
      right-minded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush!" cried Dudley, impatiently. "I well knew you would oppose my
      project, and therefore I would not reveal it to you. You shall be queen in
      spite of yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never again," rejoined Jane, mournfully;&mdash;"never again shall my brow
      be pressed by that fatal circlet. Oh! if it is for me you are about to
      engage in this wild and desperate scheme, learn that even if it succeeded,
      it will be futile. Nothing should ever induce me to mount the throne
      again; nor, if I am permitted to occupy it, to quit this calm retreat. Be
      persuaded by me, dear Dudley. Abandon your project. If you persist in it,
      I shall scarcely feel justified in withholding it from the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, madam," exclaimed Dudley, sternly; "would you destroy your husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would save him," replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A plague upon your zeal!" cried Dudley, fiercely. "If I thought you
      capable of such treachery, I would ensure your silence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I thought <i>you</i> capable, dear Dudley, of such black treason
      to a sovereign to whom you owe not merely loyalty and devotion, but life
      itself, no consideration of affection, still less intimidation, should
      prevent me from disclosing it, so that I might spare you the commission of
      so foul a crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, then," replied Dudley, in a taunting tone. "Seek Mary's presence.
      Tell her that your husband and his brothers are engaged in a plot to place
      you on the throne. Tell her that your two uncles, the Lords John and
      Thomas Grey, are conspiring with them&mdash;that your father, the Duke of
      Suffolk, is the promoter, the leader, of the design."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father!" exclaimed Jane, with a look of inexpressible anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Add that the Earl of Devon, Sir Thomas Wyat, Throckmorton, Sir Peter
      Carew, and a hundred others, are leagued together to prevent the spread of
      popery in this country&mdash;to cast off the Spanish yoke, with which the
      people are threatened, and to place a Protestant monarch on the throne.
      Tell her this, and bring your husband&mdash;your father&mdash;your whole
      race&mdash;to the block. Tell her this, and you, the pretended champion of
      the gospel, will prove yourself its worst foe. Tell her this&mdash;enable
      her to crush the rising rebellion, and England is delivered to the
      domination of Spain&mdash;to the inquisition&mdash;to the rule of the pope&mdash;to
      idolatrous oppression. Now, go and tell her this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley, Dudley," exclaimed Jane, in a troubled tone, "you put evil
      thoughts into my head&mdash;you tempt me sorely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tempt you only to stand between your religion and the danger with which
      it is menaced," returned her husband. "Since the meeting of parliament,
      Mary's designs are no longer doubtful; and her meditated union with Philip
      of Spain has stricken terror into the hearts of all good Protestants. A
      bloody and terrible season for our church is at hand, if it be not
      averted. And it <i>can</i> only be averted by the removal of the bigoted
      queen who now fills the throne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is much truth in what you say, Dudley," replied Jane, bursting into
      tears. "Christ's faithful flock are indeed in fearful peril; but bloodshed
      and rebellion will not set them right. Mary is our liege mistress, and if
      we rise against her we commit a grievous sin against heaven, and a crime
      against the state."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Crime or not," replied Dudley, "the English nation will never endure a
      Spanish yoke nor submit to the supremacy of the see of Rome. Jane, I now
      tell you that this plot may be revealed&mdash;may be defeated; but another
      will be instantly hatched, for the minds of all true Englishmen are
      discontented, and Mary will never maintain her sovereignty while she
      professes this hateful faith, and holds to her resolution of wedding a
      foreign prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this be so, still I have no title to the throne," rejoined Jane. "The
      Princess Elizabeth is next in succession, and a Protestant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need scarcely remind you," replied Dudley, "that the act just passed,
      annulling the divorce of Henry the Eighth from Catherine of Arragon, has
      annihilated Elizabeth's claims, by rendering her illegitimate. Besides,
      she has, of late, shown a disposition to embrace her sister's creed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be so given out&mdash;nay, she may encourage the notion herself,"
      replied Jane; "but I know Elizabeth too well to believe for a moment she
      could abandon her faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is enough for me she has <i>feigned</i> to do so," replied Dudley,
      "and by this means alienated her party. On <i>you</i>, Jane, the people's
      hopes are fixed. Do not disappoint them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cease to importune me further, my dear lord. I cannot govern myself&mdash;still
      less, a great nation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall occupy the throne, and entrust the reins of government to me,"
      observed Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There your ambitious designs peep forth, my lord," rejoined Jane. "It is
      for yourself, not for me you are plotting. You would be king!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would," returned Dudley. "There is no need to mask my wishes now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sooner than this shall be," rejoined Jane, severely, "I will hasten to
      Whitehall, and warn Mary of her danger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so," replied Dudley, "and take your last farewell of me. You are aware
      of the nature of the plot&mdash;of the names and object of those concerned
      in it. Reveal all&mdash;make your own terms with the queen. But think not
      you can check it. We have gone too far to retreat. When the royal guards
      come hither to convey me to the Tower, they will not find their prey, but
      they will soon hear of me. You will precipitate measures, but you will not
      prevent them. Go, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley," replied Jane, falling at his feet&mdash;"by your love or me&mdash;by
      your allegiance to your sovereign&mdash;by your duty to your Maker&mdash;by
      every consideration that weighs with you&mdash;I implore you to relinquish
      your design."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already told you my fixed determination, madam," he returned,
      repulsing her. "Act as you think proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane arose and walked slowly towards the door. Dudley laid his hand upon
      his sword, half drew it, and then thrusting it back into the scabbard,
      muttered between his ground teeth, "No, no&mdash;let her go. She dares not
      betray me."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jane reached the door, her strength failed her, and she caught against
      the hangings for support. "Dudley," she murmured, "help me&mdash;I faint."
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant, he was by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot betray your husband he said, catching her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot&mdash;I cannot," she murmured, as her head fell upon his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane kept her husband's secret. But her own peace of mind was utterly
      gone. Her walks&mdash;her studies&mdash;her occupations had no longer any
      charms for her. Even devotion had lost its solace. She could no longer
      examine her breast as heretofore&mdash;no longer believe herself
      reproachless! She felt she was an accessary to the great crime about to be
      committed; and with a sad presentiment of the result, she became a prey to
      grief,&mdash;almost to despair.

    <h2>
      XXIII.&mdash;HOW XIT WAS IMPRISONED IN THE CONSTABLE TOWER; AND HOW HE WAS
      WEDDED TO THE "SCAVENGER'S DAUGHTER."
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ersuading himself
      that his capture was matter of jest, Xit kept up his braggadocio air and
      gait, until he found himself within a few paces of the Constable Tower,&mdash;a
      fortification situated on the east of the White Tower, and resembling in
      its style of architecture, though somewhat smaller in size, the
      corresponding structure on the west, the Beauchamp Tower. As Nightgall
      pointed to this building, and told him with a malicious grin that it was
      destined to be his lodging, the dwarf's countenance fell. All his heroism
      forsook him; and casting a half-angry, half-fearful look at his guards,
      who were laughing loudly at his terrors, he darted suddenly backwards, and
      made towards a door in the north-east turret of the White Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall and the guards, not contemplating any such attempt, were taken
      completely by surprise, but immediately started after him. Darting between
      the legs of the sentinel stationed at the entrance of the turret, who
      laughingly presented his partizan at him, Xit hurried up the circular
      staircase leading to the roof. His pursuers were quickly after him,
      shouting to him to stop, and threatening to punish him severely when they
      caught him. But the louder they shouted, the swifter the dwarf fled; and,
      being endowed with extraordinary agility, arrived, in a few seconds, at
      the doorway leading to the roof. Here half-a-dozen soldiers, summoned by
      the cries, were assembled to stop the fugitive. On seeing Xit, with whose
      person they were well acquainted&mdash;never supposing he could be the
      runaway,&mdash;they inquired what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The prisoner! the prisoner!" shouted Xit, instantly perceiving their
      mistake, and pushing through them, "Where is he? What have you done with
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one has passed us," replied the soldiers. "Who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lawrence Nightgall," replied Xit, keeping as clear of them as he could.
      "He has been arrested by an order from the privy-council, and has
      escaped."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Nightgall made his appearance, and was instantly seized by
      the soldiers. An explanation quickly ensued, but, in the meantime, Xit had
      flown across the roof, and reaching the opposite turret at the south-east
      angle, sprang upon the platform, and clambering up the side of the
      building at the hazard of his neck, contrived to squeeze himself through a
      loophole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have him safe enough," cried one of the soldiers, as he witnessed
      Xit's manoeuvre. "Here is the key of the door opening into that turret,
      and he cannot get below."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he unlocked the door and admitted the whole party into a small
      square chamber, in one corner of which was the arched entrance to a flight
      of stone steps. Up these they mounted, and as they gained the room above,
      they perceived the agile mannikin creeping through the embrazure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a care!" roared Nightgall, who beheld this proceeding with
      astonishment; "You will fall into the court below and be dashed to
      pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit replied by a loud laugh, and disappeared. When Nightgall gained the
      outlet, he could see nothing of him, and after calling to him for some
      time and receiving no answer, the party adjourned to the leads, where they
      found he had gained the cupola of the turret, and having clambered up the
      vane, had seated himself in the crown by which it was surmounted. In this
      elevated, and as he fancied, secure position, he derided his pursuers, and
      snapping off a piece of the iron-work, threw it at Nightgall, and with so
      good an aim that it struck him in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A council of war was now held, and it was resolved to summon the fugitive
      to surrender; when, if he refused to comply, means must be taken to
      dislodge him. Meanwhile, the object of this consultation had been
      discovered from below. His screams and antics had attracted the attention
      of a large crowd, among whom were his friends the giants. Alarmed at his
      arrest, they had followed to see what became of him, and were passing the
      foot of the turret at the very moment when he had reached its summit. Xit
      immediately recognized them, and hailed them at the top of his voice. At
      first, they were unable to make out whence the noise proceeded; but at
      length, Gog chancing to look up, perceived the dwarf, and pointed him out
      to his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit endeavoured to explain his situation, and to induce the giants to
      rescue him; but they could not hear what he said, and only laughed at his
      gestures and vociferations. Nightgall now called to him in a peremptory
      tone to come down. Xit refused, and pointing to the crown in which he was
      seated, screamed, "I have won it, and am determined not to resign it. I am
      now in the loftiest position in the Tower. Let him bring me down who can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will be no longer trifled with," roared Nightgall. "Lend me your
      arquebuss, Winwike. If there is no other way of dislodging that
      mischievous imp, I will shoot him as I would a jackdaw."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing he was in earnest, Xit thought fit to capitulate. A rope was thrown
      him which he fastened to the vane, and after bowing to the assemblage,
      waving his cap to the giants, and performing a few other antics, he slided
      down to the leads in safety. He was then seized by Nightgall, and though
      he promised, to march as before between his guards, and make no further
      attempt to escape, he was carried, much to his discomfiture,&mdash;for
      even in his worst scrapes he had an eye to effect,&mdash;to the Constable
      Tower, and locked up in the lower chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, it has come to this," he cried, as the door was barred outside by
      Nightgall. "I am now a state prisoner in the Tower. Well, I only share the
      fate of all court favourites and great men&mdash;of the Dudleys, the
      Rochfords, the Howards, the Nevills, the Courtenays, and many others whose
      names do not occur to me. I ought rather to rejoice than be cast down that
      I am thus distinguished. But what will be the result of it? Perhaps, I
      shall be condemned to the block. If I am, what matter? I always understood
      from Mauger that decapitation was an easy death&mdash;and then what a
      crowd there will be to witness <i>my</i> execution&mdash;Xit's execution&mdash;the
      execution of the famous dwarf of the Tower! The Duke of Northumberland's
      will be nothing to it. With what an air I shall ascend the steps&mdash;how
      I shall bow to the assemblage&mdash;how I shall raise up Mauger when he
      bends his lame leg to ask my forgiveness&mdash;how I shall pray with the
      priest&mdash;address the assemblage&mdash;take off my ruff and doublet,
      and adjust my head on the block! One blow and all is over. One blow&mdash;sometimes,
      it takes two or three&mdash;but Mauger understands his business, and my
      neck will be easily divided. That's one advantage, among others, of being
      a dwarf. But to return to my execution. It will be a glorious death, and
      one worthy of me. I have half a mind to con over what I shall say to the
      assembled multitude. Let me see. Hold! it occurs to me that I shall not be
      seen for the railing. I must beg Mauger to allow me to stand on the block.
      I make no doubt he will indulge me&mdash;if not, I will not forgive him. I
      have witnessed several executions, but I never yet beheld what I should
      call a really good death. I must try to realize my own notions. But I am
      getting on a little too fast. I am neither examined, nor sentenced yet.
      Examined! that reminds me of the rack. I hope they won't torture me. To be
      beheaded is one thing&mdash;to be tortured another. I could bear anything
      in public, where there are so many people to look at me, and applaud me&mdash;but
      in private it is quite another affair. The very sight of the rack would
      throw me into fits. And then suppose I should be sentenced to be burnt
      like Edward Underhill&mdash;no, I <i>won't</i> suppose that for a moment.
      It makes me quite hot to think of it. Fool that I was, to be seduced by
      the hope of rank and dignity held out to me by the French ambassador, to
      embark in plots which place me in such jeopardy as this! However, I will
      reveal nothing. I will be true to my employer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Communing thus with himself, Xit paced to and fro within his prison, which
      was a tolerably spacious apartment, semi-circular in form, and having deep
      recesses in the walls, which were of great thickness.
    </p>

    <p>
      As he glanced around, an Idea occurred to him. "Every prisoner of
      consequence confined within the Tower carves his name on the walls," he
      said. "I must carve mine, to serve as a memorial of my imprisonment."
    </p>
    <p>
      The only implement left him was his dagger, and using it instead of a
      chisel, he carved, in a few hours, the following inscription in characters
      nearly as large as himself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

    <p class="indent15">
      1553.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time he had finished his work, he was reminded by a clamorous
      monitor within him, that he had had no supper, and he recalled with
      agonizing distinctness the many glorious meals he had consumed with his
      friends the giants. He had not even the common prisoners fare, a loaf and
      a cup of water, to cheer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely they cannot intend to starve me," he thought. "I will knock at the
      door and try whether any one is without." But though he thumped with all
      his might against it, no answer was returned. Indignant at this treatment,
      he began to rail against the giants, as if they had been the cause of his
      misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they not come to deliver me?" he cried, in a peevish voice. "The
      least they could do would be to bring me some provisions. But, I warrant
      me, they have forgotten their poor famishing dwarf, while they are
      satisfying their own inordinate appetites. What would I give for a slice
      of Hairun's wild boar now! The bare idea of it makes my mouth water. But
      the recollection of a feast is a poor stay for a hungry stomach. Cruel Og!
      barbarous Gog! inhuman Magog! where are ye now? Insensible that ye are to
      the situation of your friend, who would have been the first to look after
      you had ye been similarly circumstanced! Where are ye, I say&mdash;supping
      with Peter Trusbut, or Ribald, or at our lodging in the By-ward Tower?
      Wherever ye are, I make no doubt you have plenty to eat, whereas I, your
      best friend, who would have been your patron, if I had been raised to the
      dignity promised by De Noailles&mdash;am all but starving. It cannot be&mdash;hilloah!
      hilloah! help!" And he kicked against the door as if his puny efforts
      would burst it open. "The queen cannot be aware of my situation. She shall
      hear of it&mdash;but how?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexing himself how to accomplish this, he flung himself on a straw
      mattress in one corner, which, together with a bench and a small table
      constituted the sole furniture of the room, and in a short time fell
      asleep. He was disturbed by the loud jarring of a door, and, starting to
      his feet, perceived that two men had entered the room, one of whom bore a
      lantern, which he hold towards him. In this person Xit at once recognised
      Nightgall; and in the other, as he drew nearer, Wolfytt the sworn
      tormentor. The grim looks of the latter so terrified Xit, that he fell
      back on the mattress in an ecstacy of apprehension. His fright seemed to
      afford great amusement to the cause of it, for he burst into a coarse loud
      laugh that made the roof ring again. His merriment rather restored the
      dwarf, who ventured to inquire, in a piteous accent, whether they had
      brought him any supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay!" rejoined Wolfytt, with a grin. "Follow us, and you shall have a
      meal that shall serve you for some days to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Readily," replied Xit. "I am excessively hungry, and began to think I was
      quite forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have been employed in making all ready for you," rejoined Wolfytt. "We
      were taken a little by surprise. It is not often we have such a prisoner
      as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think not," returned Xit, whose vanity was tickled by the
      remark. "I was determined to let posterity know that <i>one</i> dwarf had
      been confined within the Tower. Bring your lantern this way, Master
      Nightgall, and you will perceive I have already carved my name on the
      wall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I see," growled Nightgall, holding the light to the inscription.
      "Bring him along, Wolfytt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not need, sir," returned Xit, with dignity. "I am ready to attend
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" exclaimed Wolfytt. "Supper awaits us, he! he!" They then passed
      through the door, Xit strutting between the pair. Descending a short
      flight of stone steps, they came to another strong door, which Nightgall
      opened. It admitted them to a dark narrow passage, which, so far as it
      could be discerned, was of considerable extent. After pursuing a direct
      course for some time, they came to an opening on the left, into which they
      struck. This latter passage was so narrow that they were obliged to walk
      singly. The roof was crusted with nitrous drops, and the floor was
      slippery with moisture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going into the worst part of the Tower," observed Xit, who began
      to feel his terrors revive. "I have been here once before. I recollect it
      leads to the Torture Chamber, the Little-Ease, and the Pit. I hope you are
      not taking me to one of those horrible places?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poh! poh!" rejoined Wolfytt, gruffly. "You are going to Master
      Nightgall's bower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His bower!" exclaimed Xit, surprised by the term&mdash;"what! where he
      keeps Cicely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of this name, Nightgall, who had hitherto maintained a
      profound silence, uttered an exclamation of anger, and regarded the dwarf
      with a withering look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can keep a secret if need be," continued Xit, in a deprecatory tone,
      alarmed at his own indiscretion. "Neither Cuthbert Cholmondeley, nor Dame
      Potentia, nor any one else, shall hear of her from me, if you desire it,
      good Master Nightgall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace!" thundered the jailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will get an extra turn of the rack for your folly, you crack-brained
      jackanapes," laughed Wolfytt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily the remark did not reach Xit's ears. He was too much frightened by
      Nightgall's savage look to attend to anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached a third door, which Nightgall unlocked and fastened
      as soon as the others had passed through it. The passage they entered was
      even darker and damper than the one they had quitted. It contained a
      number of cells, some of which, as was evident from the groans that issued
      from them, were tenanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Alexia here?" inquired Xit, whose blood froze in his veins as he
      listened to the dreadful sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alexia!" vociferated Nightgall, in a terrible voice. "What do you know of
      her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, nothing," replied Xit. "But I have heard Cuthbert
      Cholmondeley speak of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is dead," replied Nightgall, in a sombre voice; "and I will bury you
      in the same grave with her, if her name ever passes your lips again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall not, worthy sir," returned Xit,&mdash;"it shall not. Curse on my
      unlucky tongue, which is for ever betraying me into danger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now arrived at an arched doorway in the wall, which being opened
      by Nightgall, discovered a flight of steps leading to some chamber
      beneath. Nightgall descended, but Xit refused to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know where you are taking me," he cried. "This is the way to the
      torture-chamber."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolfytt burst into a loud laugh, and pushed him forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I won't go," screamed Xit, struggling with all his force against the
      tormentor. "You have no authority to treat me thus. Help! kind Og! good
      Gog! dear Magog!&mdash;help! or I shall be lamed for life. I shall never
      more be able to amuse you with my gambols, or the tricks that so much
      divert you. Help! help! I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your cries are in vain," cried Wolfytt, kicking him down the steps; "no
      one can save you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Precipitated violently downwards, Xit came in contact with Nightgall, whom
      he upset, and they both rolled into the chamber beneath, where the latter
      arose, and would have resented the affront upon his comrade, or, at all
      events, upon the dwarf, if he had not been in the presence of one of whom
      he stood in the greatest awe. This was Simon Renard, who was writing at a
      table. Disturbed by the noise, the ambassador glanced round, and on
      perceiving the cause immediately resumed his occupation. Near him stood
      the thin erect figure of Sorrocold,&mdash;his attenuated limbs appearing
      yet more meagre from the tight-fitting black hose in which they were
      enveloped, The chirurgcon wore a short cloak of sad-coloured cloth, and a
      doublet of the same material. His head was covered by a flat black cap,
      and a pointed beard terminated his hatchet-shaped, cadaverous face. His
      hands rested on a long staff, and his dull heavy eyes were fixed upon the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a short distance from Sorrocold, stood Mauger, bare-headed, and
      stripped to his leathern doublet, his arms folded upon his bosom, and his
      gaze bent upon Renard, whose commands he awaited. Nightgall's accident
      called a smile to his grim countenance, but it instantly faded away, and
      gave place to his habitual sinister expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were the formidable personages in whoso presence Xit found himself.
      Nor was the chamber less calculated to strike terror into his breast than
      its inmates. It was not the torture-room visited by Cholmondeley, when he
      explored the subterranean passages of the fortress, but another and larger
      chamber contiguous to the former, yet separated from it by a wall of such
      thickness that no sound could penetrate through it. It was square-shaped,
      with a deep round-arched recess on the right of the entrance, at the
      further end of which was a small cell, surmounted with a pointed arch. On
      the side where Renard sat, the wall was decorated with thumb-screws,
      gauntlets, bracelets, collars, pincers, saws, chains and other nameless
      implements of torture. To the ceiling was affixed a stout pulley with a
      rope, terminated by an iron hook, and two leathern shoulder-straps.
      Opposite the door-way stood a brasier, filled with blazing coals, in which
      a huge pair of pincers were thrust; and beyond it was the wooden frame of
      the rack, already described, with its ropes and levers in readiness.
      Reared against the side of the deep dark recess, previously mentioned, was
      a ponderous wheel, as broad in the felly as that of a waggon, and twice
      the circumference. This antiquated instrument of torture was placed there
      to strike terror into the breasts of those who beheld it&mdash;but it was
      rarely used. Next to it was a heavy bar of iron employed to break the
      limbs of the sufferers tied to its spokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving in whose presence he stood, and what preparations were made for
      him, Xit gave himself up for lost, and would have screamed aloud, had not
      his utterance failed him. His knees smote one another; his hair, if
      possible, grew more erect than ever; a thick damp burst upon his brow; and
      his tongue, ordinarily so restless, clove to the roof of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring forward the prisoner," cried Renard, with a stern voice, but
      without turning his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Nightgall seized Xit by the hand, and dragged him towards the
      table. A quarter of an hour elapsed, during which Renard continued writing
      as if no one were present; and Xit, who at first was half dead with
      fright, began to recover his spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency sent for me." he ventured, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" ejaculated Renard, pausing and looking at him, "I had forgotten
      thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A proof that my case is not very dangerous," thought Xit. "I must let
      this proud Spaniard see I am not so unimportant as he seems to imagine.
      Your excellency I presume, desires to interrogate me on some point," he
      continued aloud. "I pray you proceed without further delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it your excellency's pleasure that we place him on the rack?"
      interposed Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or shall we begin with the thumb-screws," observed Mauger, pointing to a
      pair upon the table; "I dare say they will extort all he knows. It would
      be a pity to stretch him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not be an inch taller for the world," rejoined Xit, raising
      himself on his tiptoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a suit of irons that will exactly fit him," observed Wolfytt,
      going to the wall, and taking down an engine that looked like an
      exaggerated pair of sugar-tongs. "These were made as a model, and have
      never been used before, except on a monkey belonging to Hairun the
      bearward. We will wed you to the 'Scavenger's Daughter,' my little man."

    <p>
      Xit knew too well the meaning of the term to take any part in the
      merriment that followed this sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The embraces of the spouse you offer me are generally fatal," he
      observed. "I would rather decline the union, if his excellency will permit
      me.1' *
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your pleasure?" asked Nightgall, appealing to Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Place him in the irons," returned the latter. "If these fail, we can have
      recourse to sharper means."
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit would have flung himself at the ambassador's feet, to ask for mercy,
      but he was prevented by Wolfytt, who slipping a gag into his mouth,
      carried him into the dark recess, and, by the help of Mauger, forced him
      into the engine. Diminished to half his size, and bent into the form of a
      hoop, the dwarf was then set on the ground, and the gag taken out of his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you like your bride?" demanded Wolfytt, with a brutal laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So little," answered Xit, "that I care not how soon I am divorced from
      her. After all," he added, "uncomfortable as I am, I would not change
      places with Magog."
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark was received with half-suppressed laughter by the group around
      him, and Wolfytt was so softened that he whispered in his ear, that if he
      was obliged to put him on the rack, he would use him as tenderly as he
      could. "Let me advise you as a friend," added the tormentor, "to conceal
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rely upon it," replied Xit, in the same tone. "I'll tell all I know&mdash;and
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the safest plan," rejoined Wolfytt, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Renard having finished his despatch, and delivered it to
      Nightgall, he ordered Xit to be brought before him. Lifting him by the
      nape of his neck, as he would have carried a lap-dog, Wolfytt placed him
      on the edge of the rack, opposite the ambassador's seat. He then walked
      back to Manger, who was leaning against the wall near the door, and laid
      his hand on his shoulder, while Nightgall seated himself on the steps. All
      three looked on with curiosity, anticipating much diversion. Sorrocold,
      who had never altered his posture, only testified his consciousness of
      what was going forward by raising his lacklustre eyes from the ground, and
      fixing them on the dwarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wheeling round on the stool, and throwing one leg indolently over the
      other, Renard regarded the mannikin with apparent sternness, but secret
      entertainment. The expression of Xit's countenance, as he underwent this
      scrutiny, was so ludicrous, that it brought a smile to every face except
      that of the chirurgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      After gazing at the dwarf for a few minutes in silence, Renard thus
      commenced&mdash;"You conveyed messages to the Earl of Devonshire when he
      was confined in the Bell Tower?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Several," replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And from whom?" demanded Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency desires me speak the truth, I conclude?" rejoined Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you attempt to prevaricate, I will have you questioned by that
      engine," returned Renard, pointing to the rack. "I again ask you by whom
      you were employed to convey these messages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency and your attendants will keep the secret if I tell you?"
      replied Xit. "I was sworn not to reveal my employer's name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No further trifling, knave," cried Renard, "or I shall deliver you to the
      tormentors. Who was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Queen," replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!" exclaimed Renard, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing is impossible to a woman in love," replied Xit; "and her
      highness, though a queen, is still a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beware how you trifle with me, sirrah," rejoined Renard. "It was M. De
      Noailles who employed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He employed me on the part of her majesty, I assure your excellency,"
      returned Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He deceived you if he told you so," replied Renard. "But now, repeat to
      me the sum of your conversations with the earl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our conversations all related to his escape," replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!" exclaimed Renard. "Now mark me, and answer me truly as you value a
      whole skin. Was nothing said of the princess Elizabeth, and of a plot to
      place her on the throne, and wed her to Courtenay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing that I remember," answered Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think again!" cried Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>do</i> recollect that upon one occasion his lordship alluded to the
      princess," answered Xit, after a moment's pretended reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what did he say?" demanded Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he was sorry he had ever made love to her," replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And well he might be," observed Renard. "But was that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every syllable," replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must assist your memory, then," said Renard. "What ho! tormentors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" cried the dwarf; "I will hide nothing from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed, then," rejoined Renard, "or I give the order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," returned Xit, "since I must needs confess the whole truth,
      the reason why the Earl of Devonshire was sorry he had made love to the
      princess was this. Her majesty sent him a letter through me, promising to
      forgive him, and restore him to her affections."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been either strangely imposed upon, or you are seeking to impose
      upon me, knave," cried Renard. "But I suspect the latter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I carried the billet myself, and saw it opened," returned Xit, "and the
      earl was so transported with its contents, that he promised to knight me
      on the day of his espousals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A safe promise, if he ever made it," rejoined Renard; "but the whole
      story is a fabrication. If her majesty desired to release the earl, why
      did she not issue her orders to that effect to Sir Henry Bedingfeld?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;but before I proceed, I must beg your excellency to desire
      your attendants to withdraw. You will perceive my motives, and approve
      them, when I offer you my explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard waved his hand, and the others withdrew, Wolfytt observing to
      Mauger, "I should like to hear what further lies the little varlet will
      invent. He hath a ready wit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, speak out&mdash;we are alone," commanded Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reason why her majesty did not choose to liberate the Earl of
      Devonshire was the fear of offending your excellency," replied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?" exclaimed Renard, bending his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a moment of pique she had affianced herself to Prince Philip of
      Spain," continued Xit. "But in her calmer moments she repented her
      precipitancy, and feeling a return of affection for the earl, she employed
      M. Do Noailles to make up the matter with him. But the whole affair was to
      be kept a profound secret from you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can this be true?" cried Renard. "But no&mdash;no&mdash;it is absurd. You
      are abusing my patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your excellency will condescend to make further inquiries you will
      find I have spoken the truth," rejoined the dwarf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I pray you not to implicate me with the queen. Her majesty, like many
      of her sex, has changed her mind, that is all. And she may change it again
      for aught I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a strange and improbable story," muttered Renard; "yet I am puzzled
      what to think of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was no paltry hope of gain that induced me to act in the matter,"
      pursued Xit; "but, as I have before intimated, a promise of being
      knighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I find, on inquiry, you have spoken the truth," rejoined Renard, "and
      you will serve me faithfully on any secret service on which I may employ
      you, I will answer for it you shall attain the dignity you aspire to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do whatever your excellency desires," returned Xit, eagerly. "I <i>shall</i>
      be knighted by somebody, after all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you have deceived me," continued Renard, sternly, "every bone in
      your body shall be broken upon that wheel. Your examination is at an end."
      With this, he clapped his hands together, and at the signal the attendants
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to remain in these irons longer?" inquired Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Renard. "Release him, and take him hence. I shall
      interrogate him at the same hour to-morrow night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray your excellency to desire these officials to treat me with the
      respect due to a person of my anticipated dignity," cried Xit, as he was
      unceremoniously seized and thrown on his back by Wolfytt; "and above all,
      command them to furnish me with provisions. I have tasted nothing
      to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard signified a wish that the latter request should be complied with,
      and the dwarf's irons being by this time removed, he was led back, by the
      road he came, to his chamber in the Constable Towrer, where some
      provisions and a flask of wine were placed before him, and he was left
      alone.

    <h2>
      XXIV.&mdash;HOW XIT ESCAPED FROM THE CONSTABLE TOWER; AND HOW HE FOUND
      CICELY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile satisfying
      his appetite, Xit could not help reflecting upon the probable consequences
      of the ridiculous statement he had made to Renard, and the idea of the
      anger of the ambassador when he discovered the deception practised upon
      him, occasioned him much internal trepidation. It did not, however,
      prevent him from doing full justice to the viands before him, nor from
      draining to the last drop the contents of the flask. Inspired by the
      potent liquid, he laughed at his former fears, sprang upon the bench, and
      committed a hundred other antics and extravagancies. But as the fumes of
      the wine evaporated, his valour declined; until, like Acres's, it fairly
      "oozed out at his fingers' ends."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then began to consider whether it might not be possible to escape. With
      this view, he examined the embrazures, but they were grated, and defied
      his efforts to pass through. He next tried the door, and to his great
      surprise found it unfastened; having, most probably, been left open
      intentionally by Wolfytt. As may be supposed, Xit did not hesitate to
      avail himself of the chance thus unexpectedly offered him. Issuing forth,
      he hurried up a small spiral stone staircase, which brought him to the
      entrance of the upper chamber. The door was ajar, and peeping cautiously
      through it, he perceived Nightgall and Wolfytt, both asleep; the former
      reclining with his face on the table, which was covered with fragments of
      meat and bread, goblets, and a large pot of wine; and the latter, extended
      at full length, on the floor. It was evident, from their heavy breathing
      and disordered attire, they had been drinking deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0065" id="linkimage-0065"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:20%;">
      <img src="images/0362.jpg" alt="0362 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0362.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Stepping cautiously into the chamber, which in size and form exactly
      corresponded with that below, Xit approached the sleepers. A bunch of keys
      hung at Nightgall's girdle&mdash;the very bunch he had taken once before,&mdash;and
      the temptation to possess himself of them was irresistible. Creeping up to
      the jailor, and drawing the poignard suspended at his right side from out
      its sheath, he began to sever his girdle. While he was thus occupied, the
      keys slightly jingled, and Nightgall, half-awakened by the sound, put his
      hand to his belt. Finding all safe, as he imagined, he disposed himself to
      slumber again, while Xit who had darted under the table at the first
      alarm, as soon as he thought it prudent, recommenced his task, and the
      keys were once more in his possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he divided the girdle, a piece of paper fell from it; and glancing at
      it, he perceived it was an order from the council to let the bearer pass
      at any hour whithersoever he would, through the fortress. Thrusting it
      into his jerkin, and carrying the keys as carefully as he could to prevent
      their clanking, he quitted the room, and mounted another short staircase,
      which brought him to the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just getting light as Xit gained the battlements, and he was
      immediately challenged by the sentinel. On producing the order, however,
      he was allowed to pass, and crossing the roof towards the south, he
      descended another short spiral staircase, and emerged from an open door on
      the ballium wall, along which he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way, he encountered three more sentinels, all of whom allowed him
      to pass on sight of the order. Passing through an arched door-way he
      mounted a flight of steps, and reached the roof of the Broad Arrow Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0066" id="linkimage-0066"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:65%;">
      <img src="images/0363.jpg" alt="0363 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0363.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Here he paused to consider what course he should pursue. The point upon
      which he stood commanded a magnificent view on every side of the ramparts
      and towers of the fortress. Immediately before him was the Wardrobe Tower&mdash;now
      removed, but then connected by an irregular pile of buildings with the
      Broad Arrow Tower,&mdash;while beyond it frowned the grey walls of the
      White Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left was the large court where the masque had been given by the
      Earl of Devonshire, at which he had played so distinguished a part,
      surrounded on the west and the south by the walls of the palace. On the
      right, the view comprehended the chain of fortifications as far as the
      Flint Tower, with the range of store-houses and other buildings in front
      of them. At the back ran the outer line of ramparts, leading northward to
      the large circular bastion, still existing, and known as the Brass Mount;
      and southward to the structure denominated the Tower leading to the Iron
      Gate, and now termed the Devil's Battery. Further on, was to be seen
      London Bridge with its pile of houses, and the tower of Saint Saviour's
      Church formed a prominent object in the picture..
    </p>
    <p>
      But Xit's attention was not attracted to the view. He only thought how he
      could make good his escape, and where he could hide himself in case of
      pursuit. After debating with himself for some time, he determined to
      descend to the lowest chamber of the fortification on which he stood and
      see whether it had any communication with the subterranean passages of
      which he possessed the keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he retraced the steps he had just mounted, and continued to
      descend till he reached an arched door. Unlocking it with one of the keys
      from his bunch, he entered a dark passage, along which he proceeded at a
      swift pace. His course was speedily checked by another door, but
      succeeding in unfastening it, he ran on as fast as his legs could carry
      him, till he tumbled headlong down a steep flight of steps. Picking
      himself up he proceeded more cautiously, and arrived, after some time,
      without further obstacle, at a lofty, and as he judged from the sound,
      vaulted chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his great dismay, though he searched carefully round it, he could find
      no exit from this chamber, and he was about to retrace his course, when he
      discovered a short ladder laid against the side of the wall. It
      immediately occurred to him that this might be used as a communication
      with some secret door, and rearing it against the wall, he mounted, and
      feeling about, to his great joy encountered a bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drawing it aside, a stone door slowly revolved on its hinges, and
      disclosed a small cell in which a female was seated before a table with a
      lamp burning upon it. She raised her head at the sound, and revealed the
      features of Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit uttered an exclamation of astonishment, and rushing towards her,
      expressed his joy at seeing her. Cicely was equally delighted at the sight
      of the dwarf, and explained to him that she had been thus long forcibly
      detained a prisoner by Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your captivity is at an end," said Xit, as her relation was concluded. "I
      am come to deliver you, and restore you to your lover. I am afraid he
      won't think your beauty improved&mdash;but I am sure he won't like you the
      worse for that. Come along. Lean on me. I will support you."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just emerging from the cell, when hasty footsteps were heard
      approaching, and a man entered the vaulted chamber, bearing a torch. It
      was Nightgall. His looks were wild and furious, and on seeing the dwarf
      and his companion, he uttered an exclamation of rage, and hurried towards
      them. Cicely ran screaming to the cell, while Xit, brandishing
      Night-gall's own poniard, threatened to stab him if he dared to mount the
      ladder.

      XXV.&mdash;OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE IMPERIAL AMBASSADORS; AND OF THE SIGNING
      OF THE MARRIAGE-TREATY BETWEEN MARY AND PHILIP OF SPAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the 2nd of
      January, 1554, a solemn embassy from the emperor Charles the Fifth,
      consisting of four of his most distinguished nobles, the Count D'Egmont,
      the Count Lalaing, the Seigneur De Courrieres, and the Sieur De Nigry,
      chancellor of the order of the Toison D'Or, arrived in London to sign the
      marriage-treaty between Philip and Mary which had been previously agreed
      upon by the courts of England and Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardiner, who as long as he found it possible to do so, had strenuously
      opposed the match, and had recommended Mary to unite herself to Courtenay,
      or at least to some English nobleman, finding her resolutely bent upon it,
      consented to negociate the terms of marriage with Renard, and took
      especial care that they were favourable to his royal mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were as follows:&mdash;The queen was to have for her jointure thirty
      thousand ducats a year, with all the Low Countries of Flanders,&mdash;her
      issue was to be heir as well to the kingdom of Spain as to the Low
      Countries,&mdash;her government was to continue in all things as before,&mdash;and
      no stranger was to be member of the council, nor have custody of any forts
      of castles, nor bear any rule or office in the queen's household, or
      elsewhere in all England.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these terms Renard, on behalf of his sovereign, readily assented, and
      the subject was brought before the Parliament where it met with violent
      opposition from all parties. In spite of this, Mary asserted her privilege
      to wed whom she pleased, and after a long and stormy discussion the
      measure, chiefly through the management of Arundel, Paget and Rochester,
      was carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the agitation of the question, Mary deemed it prudent to feign
      indisposition to avoid receiving an address intended to be presented to
      her from the Commons imploring her to marry one of her own countrymen. But
      when at length she could no longer decline giving them an audience, she
      dismissed them with these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hold my crown from God, and I beseech him to enlighten me as to the
      conduct I ought to pursue in a matter so important as my marriage. I have
      not yet determined to wed, but since you say in your address that it is
      for the welfare of the state that I should choose a husband, I will think
      of it&mdash;nothing doubting I shall make a choice as advantageous as any
      you may propose to me, having as strong an interest in the matter as
      yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was going forward, De Noailles and his party had not been idle.
      Many schemes were devised, but some were abandoned from the irresolution
      and vacillation of Courtenay; others were discovered and thwarted by
      Renard. Still, the chief conspirators, though suspected, escaped
      detection, or rather their designs could not be brought home to them, and
      they continued to form their plans as the danger grew more imminent with
      greater zeal than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time, it was determined to murder Arundel, Paget, Rochester, and
      the chief supporters of the Spanish match, to seize the person of the
      queen and compel her to marry Courtenay, or depose her and place Elizabeth
      on the throne. This plan not suiting the views of Lord Guilford Dudley and
      Suffolk, was opposed by them; and owing to the conflicting interests of
      the different parties that unity of purpose indispensable to success could
      not be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth, as has before been intimated, had dissembled her religious
      opinions, and though she formed some excuse for not being present at the
      performance of mass, she requested to have an instructor in the tenets of
      the Catholic faith, and even went so far as to write to the emperor to
      send a cross, a chalice, and other ornaments for the celebration of the
      religious rites of Rome, to decorate her chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Courtenay, he appeared to have become sensible of the perilous
      position in which he stood, and was only prevented from withdrawing from
      the struggle by his unabated passion for Elizabeth. Lord Guilford Dudley
      still cherished his ambitious views, and Jane still mourned in secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters were in this state at the commencement of the new year, when as
      above related, the ambassadors arrived from the court of Spain. Shortly
      after their arrival, they had an audience of the queen in the
      council-chamber of the White Tower; and when they had declared in due form
      that the Prince of Spain demanded her in marriage, she replied with great
      dignity, but some little prudery:&mdash;
    </p>

      "It does not become one of my sex to speak of her marriage, nor to treat
      of it herself. I have therefore charged my council to confer with you on
      the matter, and, by the strictest conditions, to assure all rights and
      advantages to my kingdom, which I shall ever regard as my first husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she pronounced the last words she glanced at the ring placed on her
      finger by Gardiner on the day of her coronation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, the four ambassadors held a conference with
      Gardiner, Arundel, and Paget. The terms were entirely settled; and on the
      12th of January, the treaty was signed, and delivered on both sides.

    <h2>
      XXVI.&mdash;BY WHAT MEANS GARDINER EXTRACTED THE SECRET OF THE CONSPIRACY
      FROM COURTENAY; AND OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DISCLOSURE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hree days after
      the marriage-treaty was signed,&mdash;namely, on the 15th of January,
      1554, the lords of the council, the lord mayor, the aldermen, and forty of
      the head commoners of the city, were summoned to the Tower, where they
      were received in the presence-chamber of the palace by Gardiner and
      Renard; the former of whom, in his capacity of chancellor, made them a
      long oration, informing them that an alliance was definitively concluded
      between the queen and Philip of Spain; and adding, "that they were bound
      to thank God that so noble, worthy, and famous a prince would so humble
      himself in his union with her highness, as to take upon him rather the
      character of a subject, than of a monarch of equal power."
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms of the treaty were next read, and the chancellor expatiated upon
      the many important concessions made by the imperial ambassadors;
      endeavouring to demonstrate that England was by far the greatest gainer by
      the alliance, and stating, "that it was her highness's pleasure and
      request, that like good subjects they would, for her sake, most lovingly
      receive her illustrious consort with reverence, joy, and honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      No plaudits followed this announcement, nor was the slightest expression
      of joy manifested, except by the lords Arundel, Paget, and Rochester,&mdash;the
      main supporters of the match, as has been previously stated, when it was
      brought before Parliament. Gardiner glanced at the council&mdash;at the
      civic authorities&mdash;as if in expectation of a reply, but none was
      attempted, unless their very silence could be so construed. Whatever his
      real sentiments might be, the chancellor assumed an air of deep
      displeasure, and turning to Renard, who, with arms folded on his breast,
      scanned the assemblage with a cold scrutinizing gaze, asked in an under
      tone, whether he should dismiss them?
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no account," replied the ambassador. "Compel them to give utterance to
      their thoughts. We shall the better know how to deal with them. My project
      once carried, and Philip united to Mary," he muttered to himself, "we will
      speedily cudgel these stubborn English bull-dogs into obedience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Renard does not appear to relish the reception which the announcement of
      her majesty's proposed alliance has met with," observed De Noailles, who
      stood in one corner of the chamber with Courtenay. "It will give him a
      foretaste of what is to follow. Had your lordship been proposed to the
      assembly, their manner would have been widely different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so," returned Courtenay, with a gratified smile; "and yet I know
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be shortly put to the proof," answered De Noailles. "Never,"
      replied Courtenay; "I will never wed Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Elizabeth?" cried the ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, Elizabeth," echoed the earl passionately, "with, or without a throne,
      she would be equally dear to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have her and the crown as well," replied De Noailles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not for the latter, provided I can obtain the former," returned
      the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One is dependent upon the other," rejoined De Noailles. "While Mary
      reigns, you must give up all hopes of Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is that conviction alone that induces me to take part in the
      conspiracy," sighed Courtenay. "I am neither ambitious to rule this
      kingdom, nor to supplant Philip of Spain. But I would risk fortune, title,
      life itself, for Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it," ejaculated De Noailles to himself, "and therefore I hold her
      out as a lure to you, weak, wavering fool! I will use you as far as I find
      necessary, but no further. Rash and harebrained as he is, Lord Guilford
      Dudley would make the better leader, and is the more likely to succeed.
      Jane's party is hourly gaining strength. Well, well, I care not who wins
      the day, provided I foil Renard, and that I will do at any cost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand marks that I read your excellency's thoughts!" cried a
      martial-looking personage, approaching them. He was attired in a coat of
      mail, with quilted sleeves, a velvet cassock, cuisses, and buff boots
      drawn up above the knee; and carried in his hand a black velvet cap,
      ornamented with broad bone-work lace. His arms were rapier and dagger,
      both of the largest size. "Is the wager accepted?" he added, taking the
      ambassador's arm within his own, and drawing him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My thoughts are easily guessed, Sir Thomas Wyat," replied De Noailles, "I
      am thinking how prosperously all goes for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," rejoined Wyat; "out of that large assemblage three only are
      favourable to the imperialists. If you approve it, I will myself&mdash;though
      not a member of the council&mdash;answer Gardiner's speech, and tell him
      we will not suffer this hateful alliance to take place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That were unwise," rejoined De Noailles, "do not meddle in the matter. It
      will only attract suspicion towards us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not if it does," replied Wyat; "we are all ready and sure of
      support. I will go further, if need be, and add, if the queen weds not
      Courtenay, a general insurrection will follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Courtenay will never wed the queen," observed the earl, who had followed
      them, and overheard the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?" exclaimed Wyat, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more at present," interposed De Noailles, hastily. "Renard's eyes are
      upon us.";
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if they are?" cried Wyat, glancing fiercely in the direction of the
      imperial ambassador. "His looks&mdash;basilisk though they be&mdash;have
      no power to strike us dead. Oh that I had an opportunity of measuring
      swords with him! He should soon perceive the love I bear his prince and
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I share in your hatred towards him," observed Courtenay. "The favour Mary
      shows him proves the ascendancy he has obtained over her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he retains his power, farewell to the liberty of Englishmen," rejoined
      Wyat; "we shall become as abject as the Flemings. But I, for one, will
      never submit to the yoke of Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so loud!" cried De Noailles, checking him. "You will effectually
      destroy our scheme. Renard only seeks some plea to attack us. Have a
      moment's patience, and some one not connected with the plot will take the
      responsibility upon himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prudence of the ambassador's counsel was speedily exemplified. While
      the conversation above related occurred, a few words passed between the
      principal members of the council, and the heads of the civic authorities,
      and, at their instance, the Earl of Pembroke stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are aware, my lord," he said, addressing Gardiner, "that we ought on
      the present occasion, to signify our approval of the queen's choice&mdash;to
      offer her our heartfelt congratulations&mdash;our prayers for her
      happiness. But we shall not seek to disguise our sentiments. We do <i>not</i>
      approve this match; and we have heard your lordship's communication with
      pain&mdash;with sorrow&mdash;with displeasure&mdash;displeasure, that
      designing counsellors should have prevailed upon her highness to take a
      step fatal to her own happiness, and to the welfare of her kingdom. Our
      solicitations are, therefore&mdash;and we earnestly entreat your lordship
      to represent them to her majesty, that she will break off this engagement,
      and espouse some English nobleman. And we further implore of her to
      dismiss from her councils the imperial ambassador, M. Simon Renard, by
      whose instrumentality this match has been contrived, and whose influence
      we conceive to be prejudicial to the interests of our country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do me wrong, Lord Pembroke," replied Renard; "and I appeal to the
      lord chancellor, whether, in negotiating this treaty, I have made any
      demands on the part of my sovereign calculated to detract from the power
      or authority of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary," replied Gardiner, "your excellency has conceded more
      than we had any right to expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And more than my brother-ambassadors deemed fitting," rejoined Renard.
      "But I do not repent what I have done,&mdash;well knowing how anxious the
      emperor Charles the Fifth is to unite his son to so wise, so excellent,
      and so religious a princess as the queen of this realm, and that no
      sacrifice could be too great to insure him her hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am bound to add that your excellency has advanced nothing but the
      truth," acquiesced Gardiner; "and though, at first, as is well known to
      Lord Pembroke and others of the council, I was as averse to the match as
      he or they could be, I am now its warmest advocate. But I will not prolong
      the discussion. Her highness's word is passed to the prince&mdash;the
      contract signed&mdash;the treaty concluded. Your remonstrances, therefore,
      are too late. And if you will suffer me to point out to you the only
      course that can with propriety be pursued, I would urge you to offer her
      majesty your loyal congratulations on her choice&mdash;to prepare to
      receive her consort in the manner she has directed&mdash;and to watch over
      the interests of your country so carefully, that the evils you dread may
      never arise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my solemn assurance will satisfy the Earl of Pembroke and the other
      honourable persons here present," remarked Renard, "I will declare, in the
      prince my master's name, that he has not the remotest intention of
      interfering with the government of this country&mdash;of engaging it in
      any war&mdash;or of placing his followers in any office or post of
      authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever may be the prince's intentions," rejoined Gardiner, "he is
      precluded by the treaty from acting upon them. At the same time, it is but
      right to add, that these terms were not wrung from his ambassador, but
      voluntarily proposed by him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will never be adhered to," cried Sir Thomas Wyat, stepping forward,
      and facing Renard, whom he regarded with a look of defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you dare to question my word, sir?" exclaimed Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," replied Wyat, sternly. "And let no Englishman put faith in one of
      your nation, or he will repent his folly. I am a loyal subject of the
      queen, and would shed my heart's blood in her defence. But I am also a
      lover of my country, and will never surrender her to the domination of
      Spain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Thomas Wyat," rejoined Gardiner, "you are well known as one of the
      queen's bravest soldiers; and it is well you are so, or your temerity
      would place you in peril."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not what the consequences are to myself, my lord," replied Wyat,
      "if the queen will listen to my warning. It is useless to proceed further
      with this match. The nation will never suffer it to take place; nor will
      the prince be allowed to set foot upon our shores."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are bold words, Sir Thomas," observed Gardiner, suspiciously.
      "Whence do you draw your conclusions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From sure premises, my lord," answered Wyat, "the very loyalty
      entertained by her subjects towards the queen makes them resolute not to
      permit her to sacrifice herself. They have not forgotten the harsh
      treatment experienced by Philip's first wife, Maria of Portugal. Hear me,
      my lord chancellor, and report what I say to her highness. If this match
      is persisted in, a general insurrection will follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a mere pretext for some rebellious design, Sir Thomas," replied
      Gardiner, sternly. "Sedition ever masks itself under the garb of loyalty.
      Take heed, sir. Your actions shall be strictly watched, and if aught
      occurs to confirm my suspicions, I shall deem it my duty to recommend her
      majesty to place you in arrest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wyat's rashness will destroy us," whispered De Noailles to Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before we separate, my lords," observed Renard, "I think it right to make
      known to you that the emperor, deeming it inconsistent with the dignity of
      so mighty a queen as your sovereign to wed beneath her own rank, is about
      to resign the crown of Naples and the dukedom of Milan to his son, prior
      to the auspicious event."
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight murmur of applause arose from the council at this announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear that," cried the Earl of Arundel. "Can you longer hesitate to
      congratulate the queen on her union?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl was warmly seconded by Paget and Rochester, but no other voice
      joined them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sense of the assembly is against it," observed the Earl of Pembroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am amazed at your conduct, my lords," cried Gardiner, angrily. "You
      deny your sovereign the right freely accorded to the meanest of her
      subjects&mdash;the right to choose for herself a husband. For shame!&mdash;for
      shame! Your sense of justice, if not your loyalty, should prompt you to
      act differently. The prince of Spain has been termed a stranger to this
      country, whereas his august sire is not merely the queen's cousin, but the
      oldest ally of the crown. So far from the alliance being disadvantageous,
      it is highly profitable, ensuring, as it does, the emperor's aid against
      our constant enemies the Scots and the French. Of the truth of this you
      may judge by the opposition it has met with, overt and secret, from the
      ambassador of the King of France. But without enlarging upon the
      advantages of the union, which must be sufficiently apparent to you all, I
      shall content myself with stating that it is not your province to dictate
      to the queen whom she shall marry, or whom she shall not marry, but humbly
      to acquiesce in her choice. Her majesty, in her exceeding goodness, has
      thought fit to lay before you&mdash;a step altogether needless&mdash;the
      conditions of her union. It pains me to say you have received her
      condescension in a most unbecoming manner. I trust, however, a better
      feeling has arisen among you, and that you will now enable me to report
      you, as I desire, to her highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The only assenting voices were those of three lords constituting the
      imperial party in the council.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having waited for a short time, Gardiner bowed gravely, and dismissed the
      assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was about to quit the presence-chamber, he perceived Courtenay
      standing in a pensive attitude in the embrasure of a window. Apparently,
      the room was entirely deserted, except by the two ushers, who, with white
      wands in their hands, were stationed on either side of the door. It
      suddenly occurred to Gardiner that this would be a favourable opportunity
      to question the Earl respecting the schemes in which he more than
      suspected he was a party, and he accordingly advanced towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard the reception which the announcement of her majesty's
      marriage has met with," he said. "I will frankly own to you it would have
      been far more agreeable to me to have named your lordship to them. And you
      have to thank yourself that such has not been the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied Courtenay, raising his eyes, and fixing them upon the
      speaker. "But I have found love more powerful than ambition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you yet love Elizabeth?" demanded Gardiner, with a slight sneer.
      "Is it possible that an attachment can endure with your lordship longer
      than a month?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never loved till I loved her," sighed Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be that as it may, you must abandon her," returned the chancellor. "The
      queen will not consent to your union."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your lordship has just observed, in your address to the council,"
      rejoined Courtenay, "that it is the privilege of all&mdash;even of the
      meanest&mdash;to choose in marriage whom they will. Since her highness
      would exert this right in her own favour, why deny it to her sister?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because her sister has robbed her of her lover," replied Gardiner.
      "Strong-minded as she is, Mary is not without some of the weaknesses of
      her sex. She could not bear to witness the happiness of a rival."
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand your meaning, my lord," pursued Gardiner sternly; "but if
      you disobey the queen's injunctions in this particular, you will lose your
      head, and so will the princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The queen's own situation is fraught with more peril than mine," replied
      Courtenay. "If she persists in her match with the prince of Spain, she
      will lose her crown, and then who shall prevent my wedding Elizabeth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardiner looked at him as he said this so fixedly, that the earl
      involuntarily cast down his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your words and manner, my lord," observed the chancellor, after a pause,
      "convince me that you are implicated in a conspiracy, known to be forming
      against the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord!" cried Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not interrupt me," continued Gardiner,&mdash;"the conduct of the
      council to-day, the menaces of Sir Thomas Wyat, your own words, convince
      me that decided measures must be taken. I shall therefore place you in
      arrest. And this time, rest assured, care shall be taken that you do not
      escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay laid his hand upon his sword, and looked uneasily at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resistance will be in vain, my lord," pursued Gardiner; "I have but to
      raise my voice, and the guard will immediately appear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not mean to execute your threats, my lord?" rejoined Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no alternative," returned Gardiner, "unless by revealing to me all
      you know respecting this conspiracy, you will enable me to crush it. Not
      to keep you longer in the dark, I will tell you that proofs are already
      before us of your connection with the plot. The dwarf Xit, employed by M.
      de Noailles to convey messages to you, and who assisted in your escape,
      has, under threat of torture, made a full confession. From him we have
      learnt that a guitar, containing a key to the cipher to be used in a
      secret correspondence, was sent to Elizabeth by the ambassador. The
      instrument has been found in the princess's possession at Ashbridge, and
      has furnished a clue to several of your own letters to her, which we have
      intercepted. Moreover some of the French ambassador's agents, under the
      disguise of Huguenot preachers, have been arrested, and have revealed his
      treasonable designs. Having thus fairly told you the nature and extent of
      the evidence against you, I would recommend you to plead guilty, and throw
      yourself upon the queen's mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are satisfied with the information you have obtained, my lord,"
      returned Courtenay, "you can require nothing further from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!&mdash;the names of your associates," rejoined Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rack should not induce me to betray them," replied Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a more persuasive engine may," rejoined the chancellor. "What if I
      offer you Elizabeth's hand provided you will give up all concerned in this
      plot?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reject it," replied the earl, struggling between his sense of duty and
      passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I must call the guard," returned the chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold!" cried Courtenay, "I would barter my soul to the enemy of mankind
      to possess Elizabeth. Swear to me she shall be mine, and I will reveal
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardiner gave the required pledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet if I confess, I shall sign my own condemnation, and that of the
      princess," hesitated Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," rejoined the chancellor. "In the last session of parliament it
      was enacted, that those only should suffer death for treason, who had
      assisted at its commission, either by taking arms themselves, or aiding
      directly and personally those who <i>had</i> taken them. Such as have
      simply known or approved the crime are excepted&mdash;and your case is
      among the latter class. But do not let us tarry here. Come with me to my
      cabinet, and I will resolve all your scruples."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will ensure me the hand of the princess?" said Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly," answered Gardiner. "Have I not sworn it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And they quitted the presence-chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner were they gone, than two persons stepped from behind the arras
      where they had remained concealed during the foregoing conversation. They
      were De Noailles and Sir Thomas Wyat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfidious villain!" cried the latter, "I breathe more freely since he is
      gone. I had great difficulty in preventing myself from stabbing him on the
      spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would have been a useless waste of blood," replied De Noailles. "It
      was fortunate that I induced you to listen to their conversation. We must
      instantly provide for our own safety, and that of our friends. The
      insurrection must no longer be delayed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall not be delayed an hour," replied Wyat. "I have six thousand
      followers in Kent, who only require to see my banner displayed to flock
      round it. Captain Bret and his company of London trainbands are eagerly
      expecting our rising. Throckmorton will watch over the proceedings in the
      city. Vice-Admiral Winter, with his squadron of seven sail, now in the
      river, under orders to escort Philip of Spain, will furnish us with
      ordnance and ammunition; and, if need be, with the crews under his
      command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can be better," replied De Noailles. "We must get the Duke of
      Suffolk out of the Tower, and hasten to Lord Guilford Dudley, with whom
      some plan must be instantly concerted. Sir Peter Carew must start
      forthwith for Devonshire,&mdash;Sir James Croft for Wales. Your
      destination is Kent. If Courtenay had not proved a traitor, we would have
      placed him on the throne. As it is, my advice is, that neither Elizabeth
      nor Jane should be proclaimed, but Mary Stuart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There the policy of France peeps out," replied Wyat. "But I will proclaim
      none of them. We will compel the queen to give up this match, and drive
      the Spaniard from our shores."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you will," replied De Noailles, hastily. "Do not let us remain longer
      here, or it maybe impossible to quit the fortress."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, they left the palace, and seeking the Duke of Suffolk,
      contrived to mix him up among their attendants, and so to elude the
      vigilance of the warders. As soon as they were out of the Tower, Sir
      Thomas Wyat embarked in a wherry, manned by four rowers, and took the
      direction of Gravesend. De Noailles and the Duke of Suffolk hastened to
      Sion House, where they found Lord Guilford Dudley seated with Jane and
      Cholmondeley. On their appearance, Dudley started to his feet, and
      exclaimed, "We are betrayed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are," replied De Noailles. "Courtenay has played the traitor. But this
      is of no moment, as his assistance would have been of little avail, and
      his pretensions to the crown might have interfered with the rights of your
      consort. Sir Thomas Wyat has set out for Kent. We must collect all the
      force we can, and retire to some place of concealment till his messengers
      arrive with intelligence that he is marching towards London. We mean to
      besiege the Tower, and secure the queen's person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley," cried Jane, "if you have one spark of honour, gratitude, or
      loyalty left, you will take no part in this insurrection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mary is no longer queen," replied her husband, bending the knee before
      her. "To you, Jane, belongs that title; and it will be for you to decide
      whether she shall live or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The battle is not yet won," observed the Duke of Suffolk. "Let us obtain
      the crown before we pass sentence on those who have usurped it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lady Jane must accompany us," whispered De Noailles to Dudley. "If
      she falls into the hands of our enemies, she may be used as a formidable
      weapon against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," cried Jane, kneeling to the Duke of Suffolk; "if my
      supplications fail to move my husband, do not you turn a deaf car to them.
      Believe me, this plot will totally fail, and conduct us all to the
      scaffold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The duke cannot retreat if he would, madam," interposed Do Noailles.
      "Courtenay has betrayed us all to Gardiner, and ere now I doubt not
      officers are despatched to arrest us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane, you must come with us," cried Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never," she replied, rising. "I will not stir from this spot. I implore
      you and my father to remain here likewise, and submit yourselves to the
      mercy of the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you think such conduct befitting the son of the great Duke of
      Northumberland?" replied Dudley. "No, madam, the die is cast. My course is
      taken. You <i>must</i> come with us. There is no time for preparation. M.
      De Noailles, I place myself entirely in your hands. Let horses be brought
      round instantly," he added, turning to his esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall be at the gate almost before you can reach it, my lord,"
      returned Cholmondeley. "There are several ready-saddled within the
      stables."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," replied Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the esquire departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, dear father," cried Jane, "you will not go. You will not leave
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the duke averted his gaze from her, and rushed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Noailles made a significant gesture to Dudley, and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," cried Dudley, taking her hand, "I entreat&mdash;nay command you&mdash;to
      accompany me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley," she replied, "I cannot&mdash;will not&mdash;obey you in this. If
      I could, I would detain you. But as I cannot, I will take no part in your
      criminal designs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell for ever, then," rejoined Dudley, breaking from her. "Since you
      abandon me in this extremity, and throw off my authority, I shall no
      longer consider myself bound to you by any ties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay!" replied Jane. "You overturn all my good resolutions. I am no
      longer what I was. I cannot part thus."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it," replied Dudley, straining her to his bosom. "You will go with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," replied Jane, "since you will have it so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, then," cried Dudley, taking her hand, and leading her towards the
      door&mdash;"to the throne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Jane, sadly&mdash;"to the scaffold!"

    <h2>
      XXVII.&mdash;OF THE INSURRECTION OF SIR THOMAS WYAT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he party had not
      quitted Sion House more than an hour, when a band of soldiers, headed by
      Sir Edward Hastings, master of the horse, and one of the privy council,
      arrived to arrest them. But no traces of their retreat could be
      discovered; and after an unsuccessful search, Hastings was compelled to
      return to Gardiner with the tidings that their prey had escaped. Not one
      of the conspirators charged by Courtenay could be found, and it was
      evident they had received timely warning, though from what quarter the
      chancellor could not divine. At first, his suspicions fell upon the Earl
      of Devonshire, but the utter impossibility of this being the case speedily
      made him reject the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A council was immediately held; at which several resolutions, founded upon
      the information obtained from Courtenay, were passed. Fresh troops were
      ordered into the Tower, and active preparations made for its defence, in
      case of a siege. The chancellor himself deemed it prudent to wear a coat
      of mail beneath his robes; and quitting his palace, old Winchester House,
      situated on the Surrey side of the river, a little to the west of Saint
      Saviour's, he took up his abode within the fortress. Mary was also advised
      to remove thither from Whitehall, and, at the instance of Renard, she
      reluctantly complied.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day after her return to the Tower, the imperial ambassadors,
      D'Egmont, Lalaing, De Courrieres, and De Nigry, were conducted by the Earl
      of Arundel to Saint John's Chapel, where they found the whole of the
      council assembled, and the queen kneeling before the altar. The sacrament
      was administered by Gardiner, and high mass performed; after which Mary,
      kneeling with her face to the assemblage, said: "I take God to witness
      that I have not consented to wed the prince of Spain from any desire of
      aggrandizement, or carnal affection; but solely for the honour and profit
      of my kingdom, and the repose and tranquillity of my subjects. Nor shall
      my marriage prevent me from keeping inviolably the oath I have made to the
      crown, on the day of my coronation." Uttered with great earnestness and
      dignity, these words produced a strong effect upon the hearers.
      Ratifications of the treaty were then exchanged, and the customary oaths
      taken on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ceremony over, the queen arose, and glancing at the council,
      observed: "I have heard, my lords, that most of you highly disapprove my
      match with the prince of Spain; but I feel confident, when you have well
      considered the matter, you will see cause to alter your opinion. However
      this may be, I am well assured that your loyalty will remain unchanged,
      and that I may fully calculate upon your services for the defence and
      protection of my person, in case the rebellion with which I am threatened
      should take place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness may rely upon us all," replied the Duke of Norfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the assurance was reiterated by the whole assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, an attendant stepped forward, and informed the queen that
      a messenger who had ridden for his life, was arrived from Kent, bringing
      intelligence of an insurrection in that county.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him approach," replied Mary. "You shall hear, my lords, what danger
      we have to apprehend. Well, fellow," she continued, as the man was ushered
      into her presence, "thy news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the bearer of ill tidings, your majesty," replied the messenger,
      bending the knee before her. "Sir Thomas Wyat yesterday, by sound of
      trumpet published, in the market-place at Maidstone a proclamation against
      your highness's marriage; exhorting all Englishmen wishing well to their
      country to join with him and others, to defend the realm from the
      threatened thraldom of Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! traitor!" exclaimed the queen. "And how was the proclamation
      received?&mdash;Speak out&mdash;and fear not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With universal acclamations," replied the messenger, "and shouts of 'A
      Wyat! A Wyat! No Spanish match&mdash;no inquisition! I and such
      treasonable vociferations. Sir Thomas had fifteen hundred men in arms with
      him, but before he quitted Maidstone, above five hundred more joined him,
      and multitudes were flocking to his standard when I left the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the messenger concluded his recital, when another was
      introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What further news hast thou, good fellow?1' demanded the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am come to inform your highness," replied the man, "that Sir Thomas
      Wyat and his followers have taken possession of the castle of Rochester,
      and fortified it as well as the town. Moreover, they have broken down the
      bridge across the Medway, and stop all passengers, by land or water,
      taking from them their arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now by our lady!" exclaimed the queen, "this Wyat is a hardy traitor. But
      he shall meet with the punishment due to his offences. Your grace," she
      added, turning to the Duke of Norfolk, "shall march instantly against him
      with a sufficient force to dislodge him from his hold. And for your better
      defence, you shall take with you the trained bands of our good city of
      London, under the command of Captain Bret."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, she quitted the chapel, and returned to the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he could collect his forces, amounting to about a thousand men,
      the Duke of Norfolk, accompanied by Bret and the trained bands, set out on
      his expedition, and arrived at Stroud the same night, where he made
      preparations to besiege Rochester castle at daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the utmost anxiety prevailed within the Tower, and tidings of
      the issue of the expedition were eagerly looked for. Towards the close of
      the day after Norfolk's departure, a messenger arrived, bringing the
      alarming intelligence that Bret and his band had revolted to Wyat,
      shouting, "We are all Englishmen!&mdash;we are all Englishmen!&mdash;We
      will not fight against our countrymen." It was added, that the duke, who
      had just planted his cannon against the castle, seeing how matters stood,
      and being uncertain of the fidelity of the troops remaining with him, had
      made a hasty retreat, leaving his ammunition and horses in the hands of
      the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This intelligence struck terror into the hearts of all who heard it, and
      it was the general impression that the insurgents would be victorious&mdash;an
      opinion considerably strengthened, a few hours afterwards, by the arrival
      of other messengers, who stated that Wyat had besieged and taken Cowling
      castle, the residence of Lord Cobham, and was marching towards London. It
      was also affirmed that he had been joined by Lord Guilford Dudley, the
      Duke of Suffolk, Lord Thomas Grey, and others, with a considerable force,
      and that their object was to depose Mary, and replace Jane upon the
      throne. Humours of insurrections in other parts of the country as well as
      in London were added; but these could not be so well authenticated.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following day, it being ascertained that the rebels had reached
      Dartford, Sir Edward Hastings and Sir Thomas Cornwallis were sent to hold
      a parley with the rebels. The army of the insurgents was stationed at the
      west of the town, before which their ordnance was planted. Dismounting,
      the two knights sent forward a herald to Wyat, who was standing with
      Dudley, Suffolk, and Bret, near the outworks; and on learning their
      business, he immediately advanced to meet them. After a haughty salutation
      on both sides, Sir Edward Hastings spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Thomas Wyat," he said, "the queen desires to know why you, who style
      yourself, in your proclamations, her true subject, act the part of a
      traitor in gathering together her liege subjects in arms against her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am no more a traitor than yourself, Sir Edward Hastings," replied Wyat,
      "and the reason why I have gathered together the people, is to prevent the
      realm from being overrun by strangers, which must happen, if her
      highness's marriage with Philip of Spain takes place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No strangers are yet arrived," replied Hastings, "and the mischief you
      apprehend is yet far off. But if this is your only grievance, are you
      content to confer on the matter with the council?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," replied Wyat; "but I will be trusted rather than trust. I will
      treat with whomsoever the queen desires; but in surety of her good faith,
      I must have delivered to me the custody of the Tower of London, and of her
      highness's person. Furthermore, I require the head of Simon Renard, the
      originator of this tumult.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insolent!" cried Hastings. "Rather than your traitorous demands shall be
      complied with, you and all your rabble rout shall be put to the sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, he sprang upon his steed, and accompanied by Cornwallis
      and his attendants, rode back to the Tower, to declare the ill success of
      his mission to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wyat's successes created the greatest consternation among the queen's
      party. Though the Tower was filled with armed men, its inmates did not
      feel secure, being in constant apprehension of a rising in London. The
      imperial ambassadors were not less alarmed, as it was generally thought
      they would be sacrificed to the popular fury. Gardiner counselled them to
      make good their retreat to Brussels; and they all, with the exception of
      Simon Renard, who declared he would remain upon his post, decided upon
      following the advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would not, however, depart without taking leave of Mary, who desired
      them to recommend her to the emperor, and to assure him she was under no
      alarm for her personal safety. Costly presents were offered them; but,
      under the circumstances, they were declined. The ambassadors quitted the
      Tower at dead of night, embarking at Traitor's Gate, and were compelled to
      leave their horses, attendants, and baggage, behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the secrecy of their departure, it was discovered, and an
      attempt was made to capture them by some watermen, who in all probability
      would have succeeded, if they had not been driven off by the batteries of
      the fortress. Fortunately, the fugitives found a fleet of merchantmen,
      armed with a few guns, ready to sail for Antwerp; in one of which they
      embarked, and under cover of night, got safely down the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning, news was brought that Wyat was within a few
      miles of London; and it was added that his appearance before the walls of
      the fortress would be the signal for the rising of the citizens,&mdash;that
      the gates of the city would be thrown open to him, and perhaps those of
      the Tower itself. Every possible precaution was taken by Sir Henry
      Bedingfeld. He visited the whole line of ramparts and fortifications, and
      ascertained that all the men were at their posts, and in readiness, in
      case of a sudden attack. By his directions, the drawbridges on London
      Bridge were broken down&mdash;the craft moored on the Middlesex side of
      the river&mdash;the ferry-boats staved and sunk&mdash;and the bridges for
      fifteen miles up the river destroyed. While this was going on, Gardiner,
      seriously alarmed by the aspect of things, sought the queen's presence,
      and endeavoured to persuade her to fly to France. But Mary, who, it has
      been more than once observed, inherited all the lion spirit of her father,
      and whose courage rose in proportion to the danger by which she was
      surrounded, at once, and disdainfully, rejected the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My people may abandon <i>me</i>," she said, "but I will never abandon <i>them</i>.
      I have no fear of the result of this struggle, being well assured I have
      plenty of loyal English hearts to serve and defend me. If need be, I will
      take up arms myself, and try the truth of this quarrel; for I would rather
      die with those who will stand by me, than yield one jot to such a traitor
      as Wyat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty is in the right," replied Renard, who was present on the
      occasion, "if you fly, all is lost. My counsel to you is to resort to the
      severest measures. Since Lady Jane Grey has disappeared, and you cannot
      avenge yourself upon her, let the Princess Elizabeth be brought from
      Ashbridge to the fortress, and on the appearance of Wyat, have a scaffold
      erected on the summit of Traitor's Tower, and if the arch-rebel will not
      withdraw his forces, put her and Courtenay to death in his sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like not your proposal, sir," replied the queen, "I have no thirst for
      Courtenay's blood. Nay, the love I once bore him would prevent my taking
      his life&mdash;and it should only be at the last extremity that I would
      deal severely with Elizabeth. Neither do I think your counsel politic.
      Such a course might answer in Spain, but not in England. It would only
      inflame still more the minds of the seditious, and excite them to a state
      of ungovernable fury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You judge wisely, madam," replied Gardiner. "Besides, I have made myself
      answerable for the safety of the Earl of Devonshire. The blow that falls
      upon his head, must strike mine also. Since your majesty, with a
      resolution worthy of the daughter of your great sire, decides on
      maintaining your ground against these rebels, I nothing fear for the
      result. Let the worst come to the worst, we can but die; and we will die
      fighting in your cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," rejoined the queen, after a moment's reflection, "bid Sir Henry
      Bedingfeld, and the whole of the officers and men not required on duty on
      the ramparts, attend high mass within Saint John's chapel an hour hence.
      You yourself will officiate with all the prelates and priesthood in the
      fortress. The service over, I shall repair to the council-chamber, where
      it is my purpose to address them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gardiner bowed and retired to execute her commands, and the queen
      enjoining Renard's attendance at the chapel, retired to her closet with
      her dames of honour.

    <h2>
      XXVIII.&mdash;OF THE QUEEN'S SPEECH IN THE COUNCIL-CHAMBER; AND OF HER
      INTERVIEW WITH SIR THOMAS WYAT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the appointed
      time, Saint John's chapel was thronged with armed men; and as the royal
      train passed along the upper gallery, and glanced down upon them, Mary was
      inexpressibly struck by the scene. Banners waved from the arched openings
      of the gallery, and the aisles and nave gleamed with polished steel. For
      fear of a sudden surprise, the soldiers were ordered to carry their
      weapons, and this circumstance added materially to the effect of the
      picture. Around the columns of the southern aisle were grouped the
      arquebussiers with their guns upon their shoulders; around those of the
      north stood the pike-men, in their steel caps and corslets; while the
      whole body of the nave was filled with archers, with their bows at their
      backs. Immediately in front of the altar stood the Duke of Norfolk, the
      Earls of Arundel and Pembroke, the lords Paget and Rochester; Sir Henry
      Bedingfeld; Sir Henry Jerningham, master of the horse; Sir Edward Bray,
      master of the ordnance, all in full armour. On the queen's appearance all
      these personages bent the knee before her; and Bedingfeld, in virtue of
      his office, advancing a step before the others, drew his sword, and vowed
      he would never yield up the fortress but with life. He then turned to the
      troops, and repeated his determination to them. And the walls of the
      sacred structure rang with the shouts of the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have yet loyal followers enow who will shed their last drop of blood
      in your defence," he added to Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I nothing doubt it, dear Sir Henry," she replied, in a voice of deep
      emotion. "I will share your danger, and, I trust, your triumph."
    </p>
    <p>
      Solemn mass was then performed by Gardiner, who was attended by Bonner,
      Tunstal, Feckenham, and other prelates and priests in their full robes. On
      its conclusion, the queen gave her hand to Sir Henry Bedingfeld, and
      followed by the whole assemblage, proceeded to the council-chamber, and
      took her seat beneath the state canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the whole party was assembled, silence was commanded, and Mary
      spoke as follows: "I need not acquaint you that a number of Kentish rebels
      have seditiously and traitorously gathered together against us and you.
      Their pretence, as they at first asserted, was to resist a marriage
      between us and the prince of Spain. To this pretended grievance, and to
      the rest of their evil-contrived complaints, you have been made privy.
      Since then, we have caused certain of our privy council to confer with the
      rebels, and to demand the cause of their continuance in their seditious
      enterprise; and by their own avowal it appears that our marriage is the
      least part of their quarrel. For they now, swerving from their first
      statement, have betrayed the inward treason of their hearts, arrogantly
      demanding the possession of our person, the keeping of our Tower of
      London, and not only the placing and displacing of our council, but also
      the head of one who is an ambassador at our court, and protected by his
      office from injury."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a murmur of indignation arose among the assemblage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, loving subjects," continued Mary, "what I am you right well know. I
      am your queen, to whom, at my coronation, when I was wedded to the realm,
      and to the laws of the realm, (the spousal ring whereof I hold on my
      finger, never as yet left off, nor hereafter to be so), you promised your
      allegiance and obedience. And that I am the right and true inheritor of
      the crown of England, I not only take all Christendom to witness, but also
      your own acts of parliament confirming my title. My father, as you all
      know, possessed the regal estate by right of inheritance; and by the same
      right it descended to me. To him you always showed yourselves faithful
      subjects, and obeyed and served him as your liege lord and king. And,
      therefore, I doubt not you will show yourselves equally loyal to me, his
      daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save your highness!" cried the whole assemblage. "Long live Queen
      Mary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you are what I believe you," pursued Mary, energetically; "you will
      not suffer any rebel to usurp the governance of our person, nor to occupy
      our estate, especially so presumptuous a traitor as this Wyat, who having
      abused our subjects to be adherents to his traitorous quarrel, intends,
      under some plea, to subdue the laws to his will, and to give scope to the
      rascal and forlorn persons composing his army to make general havoc and
      spoil of our good city of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down with Wyat!" cried several voices. "Down with the rebels!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never having been a mother," continued Mary, "I cannot tell how naturally
      a parent loves her children: but certainly a queen may as naturally and as
      tenderly love her subjects as a mother her child. Assure yourselves,
      therefore, that I, your sovereign lady, do as tenderly love and favour
      you; and thus loving you, I cannot but think that you as heartily and
      faithfully love me again. And so, joined together in a knot of love and of
      concord, I doubt not we shall be able to give these rebels a short and
      speedy overthrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she was again interrupted by the most enthusiastic expressions of
      loyalty and devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the word of a queen I promise you," concluded Mary, "if it shall not
      appear to the nobility and commons in parliament assembled, that my
      intended marriage is for the benefit of the whole realm, I will not only
      abstain from it, but from any other alliance. Pluck up your hearts, then,
      and like true men stand fast with your lawful queen against these rebels,
      both my enemies and yours, and fear them not, for I fear them nothing at
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thundering plaudits followed Mary's oration, which, it was evident, had
      produced the desired effect upon the assemblage; and if any one entered
      the council-chamber wavering in his loyalty, he returned confirmed in his
      attachment to the throne. Mary's intrepid demeanour was sufficient to
      inspire courage in the most faint-hearted; and her spirit imparted an
      expression of beauty to her countenance which awakened the warmest
      admiration among all the beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have proved yourself a worthy daughter of your august sire, madam,"
      observed Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>will</i> prove myself so before I have done, Sir Henry," rejoined
      Mary, smiling. "I trust myself wholly to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty may depend upon me," replied the old knight. "And now, with
      your permission, I will withdraw my forces, and visit the ramparts. After
      your address no one will forsake his post."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he departed with the troops, and, after making his rounds,
      returned to his lodgings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mary then appointed Lord William Howard, in conjunction with the Lord
      Mayor, Sir Thomas White, to the government of the city, and the Earl of
      Pembroke to the command of the army. These arrangements made, she
      continued for some time in conference with Gardiner and Renard. Just as
      she was about to retire, Sir Henry Bedingfeld came to apprise her that
      Wyat's army had reached Southwark, and had taken up a position at the foot
      of London Bridge. After mature deliberation, it was resolved that the
      rebel-leader should be invited to an interview with the queen; and
      Bedingfeld was intrusted with the mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proceeding to Traitor's Gate, the old knight embarked in a wherry with
      four soldiers and a herald, and was rowed towards the hostile party. As he
      drew near the Surrey side of the water, Wyat's sentinels presented their
      calivers at him; but as soon as they perceived he was attended by a
      herald, they allowed him to approach. On learning his errand, Wyat,
      contrary to the advice of the Duke of Suffolk and Lord Guilford Dudley,
      determined to accompany him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will fall into some snare," observed Dudley, "and lose the day when
      you have all but gained it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have no fears," replied Wyat. "We shall conquer without striking a blow.
      Mary would not have made this proposal to me had she not felt certain of
      defeat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But dare you trust her?" demanded Suffolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Henry Bedingfeld has pledged his word for my safe return, and I know
      him too well to doubt it. Farewell, my lords. We shall meet again in an
      hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I much doubt if we shall meet again at all," observed Dudley to the duke,
      as Wyat stepped into Bedingfeld's wherry, which was rowed swiftly across
      the river, and presently disappeared beneath the gloomy arch of Traitor's
      Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ushered into the council-chamber, Wyat found Mary seated on a chair of
      state placed at the head of a row of chairs near a partition dividing the
      vast apartment, and covered with arras representing various naval
      engagements. The wooden pillars supporting the roof were decorated with
      panoplies; and through an opening on the right of the queen, Wyat
      perceived a band of armed men, with their leader at their head, cased in
      steel, and holding a drawn sword in his hand. Noticing these formidable
      preparations with some uneasiness, he glanced inquiringly at Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing," observed the old knight. "My head shall answer for yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus re-assured, Wyat advanced more confidently towards the queen, and
      when within a few paces of her, paused and drew himself up to his full
      height. Bedingfeld took up a station on the right of the royal chair, and
      supported himself on his huge two-handed sword. On the left stood Gardiner
      and Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sent for you, traitor and rebel that you are," commenced Mary, "to
      know why you have thus incited my subjects to take up arms against me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am neither traitor nor rebel, madam," replied Wyat, "as I have already
      declared to one of your council, and I but represent the mass of your
      subjects, who being averse to your union with the prince of Spain, since
      you refuse to listen to their prayers, are determined to make themselves
      heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! God's death! sir," cried Mary, furiously, "do you, or do any of my
      subjects think they can dispose of me in marriage as they think proper?
      But this is an idle pretext. Your real object is the subversion of my
      government, and my dethronement. You desire to place the princess
      Elizabeth on the throne&mdash;and in default of her, the Lady Jane Grey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desire to uphold your majesty's authority," replied Wyat, "provided you
      will comply with my demands."
    </p>
    <p>

      "<i>Demands!</i>" cried Mary, stamping her foot, while her eyes flashed
      fire. "It is the first time such a term has been used to me, and it shall
      be the last. In God's name, what are your demands? Speak, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These, madam," replied Wyat, firmly. "I demand the custody of the Tower,&mdash;the
      care of your royal person,&mdash;the dismissal of your council,&mdash;and
      the head of your false counsellor, Simon Renard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will nothing less content you?" inquired Mary, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," returned Wyat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray your majesty to allow me to punish the insolence of this daring
      traitor," cried Renard, in extremity of fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peace, sir," rejoined Mary, majestically. "Now hear me in turn, thou
      traitor Wyat. No man ever dictated terms to my father, and, by his memory!
      none shall do so to me. At once, and peremptorily, I reject your
      conditions; and had not Sir Henry Bedingfeld pledged his word for your
      safety, my guards should have led you from hence to the scaffold. Quit my
      presence, and as I would rather be merciful than severe, and spare the
      lives of my subjects than destroy them, if you disperse your host, and
      submit yourself to my mercy, I will grant you a free pardon. Otherwise,
      nothing shall save you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we next meet your majesty may alter your tone," rejoined Wyat; "I
      take my leave of your highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he bowed and retired with Sir Henry Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will not let him escape?" cried Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In sooth but I shall sir," replied Mary; "my word must be kept even with
      a traitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are over-scrupulous, madam," rejoined Renard; "there is no faith to
      be kept with such a villain. Beseech you, let me follow him. His head,
      displayed to his companions, will disperse them more speedily than your
      whole army."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said it must not be," replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay then," rejoined Renard, "I will take the responsibility of the act
      upon myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Disobeyed!" exclaimed Mary, authoritatively. "I command you not to leave
      the presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will repent this mistaken clemency," cried Renard, chafing
      with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never repent adhering to my word," returned Mary. "And see here
      comes our lieutenant. How now, Sir Henry? Is the traitor gone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, your highness," replied Bedingfeld; "and it required all my
      authority to prevent the infuriated guard from falling upon him, and
      cutting him in pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad you were with him," replied Mary; "I would not for the best
      jewel in my crown that any harm had happened to him. Give me your hand,
      Sir Henry. I will myself visit the ramparts, and cheer the soldiers with
      my presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will expose yourself," returned Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom?" replied Mary,&mdash;"only to my subjects. They will not dare to
      assail their queen. The daughter of your old master, Henry the Eighth,
      should have no fear."

    <h2>
      XXIX.&mdash;THE SIEGE OF THE TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n Wyat's return,
      it was resolved that, under cover of darkness, the Duke of Suffolk and
      Lord Guilford Dudley should march with two detachments of men to Deptford,
      where a squadron of seven sail commanded by Admiral Winter, together with
      a number of lesser craft, awaited them. Dudley and his party were then to
      cross the river in Winter's boats, and proceed to East Smithfield; while
      Suffolk was to embark his men in the larger vessels, and to sail up the
      river with the tide. Wyat determined to attempt a passage across London
      Bridge, and if this could not be accomplished, to abide the arrival of
      Winter's squadron.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then arranged that the attack should take place two hours before
      dawn. The fortress was to be assailed simultaneously at three different
      points, so as to distract the attention of its defenders. To Lord Guilford
      Dudley was assigned the Brass Mount, and the north-east angle of the
      ramparts; to the Duke of Suffolk Traitor's Tower, and the southern
      fortifications; and to Wyat the Middle Tower, and the By-ward Tower,&mdash;two
      of the strongest defences of the fortress. If the attack proved
      successful, the three leaders were to concentrate their forces before the
      gateway of the Bloody Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was sufficiently dark, Suffolk and Dudley placed themselves at the
      head of their detachments and set out. Though they moved along with the
      utmost caution, they were heard by the soldiers on the ramparts, who
      reported their suspicions to Bedingfeld, and precautions were taken
      accordingly, though it was the opinion of many that the rebels had beat a
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight, Wyat prepared to cross London Bridge. Aware that the
      drawbridges were cut away&mdash;that it was barricaded, and strongly
      defended&mdash;he provided himself with planks and ropes, and issuing
      instructions to his men, set forward. They were allowed to proceed without
      molestation to the first drawbridge, but here a sharp fire was opened upon
      them. In spite of this, Wyat succeeded in laying down a plank, and, at the
      head of a dozen men, crossed it. Dislodging their opponents, several other
      planks were laid down, and the passage being rendered secure, the whole
      party crossed, and carried over their ammunition in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the attack soon reached the city-guard. Drums were beaten,
      trumpets sounded, and shouts heard in every direction. While this was
      passing, a well-contested fight took place at the barricades in the centre
      of the bridge, between their defenders and the insurgents. Having broken
      down these obstacles, Wyat drove all before him. Still, another and wider
      chasm lay between him and the Middlesex shore. In front of it, the
      assailed party made a desperate stand; but their resistance was
      unavailing. Many were precipitated into the yawning gulf, and drowned;
      while others threw down their arms, and besought mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the further side of the chasm, a formidable array of soldiery opposed
      the progress of the rebel-army, and a piece of ordnance did terrible
      execution amongst them. Two planks were hewn asunder as soon as they were
      thrust across the abyss; but the moment the third was laid down, Wyat
      dashed across it, and drove back two men with hatchets in their hands who
      were about to sever it. He was followed by half-a-dozen soldiers. In this
      instance, his fiery courage had well nigh proved fatal to him for no
      sooner had the small band crossed it, than the plank was hurled into the
      chasm, and Wyat left, with his trifling party, to contend against the
      whole host of his foes. His destruction appeared inevitable, but his
      self-possession stood him in good stead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fellow-countrymen," he shouted, "I am your friend, not your enemy. I
      would deliver you from thraldom and oppression. You ought rather to aid
      than oppose me. You are upholding Spain&mdash;and the inquisition&mdash;while
      I am fighting for England and liberty."
    </p>
    <p>
      These few words, vociferated while he made a desperate stand against his
      opponents, turned the tide of affairs. In vain the royalist leaders
      shouted "Down with the rebels! the queen!&mdash;the queen!" They were
      answered by deafening cries of "A Wyat! a Wyat! No Philip of Spain&mdash;no
      Popish supremacy&mdash;no inquisition!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid this tumult, the insurgents, who had witnessed with dismay the
      perilous position of their leader, redoubled their exertions; and placing
      several planks across the gulf, crossed them, and flew to his assistance.
      Following up the advantage he had gained, Wyat, without difficulty, routed
      his opponents. He then paused to cover the passage of the remainder of his
      troops and artillery across the chasm, which was safely accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of Fish-street-hill, they were checked by a company of horse
      under the command of the Earl of Pembroke, and a skirmish took place, in
      which the royalists were worsted with severe loss, and many prisoners
      taken, as well as arms and horses. Pembroke however, escaped and retreated
      to the Tower, bringing the news of his own defeat and of the successes of
      the rebels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The citizens showed little disposition to take part in the struggle. All
      they were uneasy about was the security of their property; but Wyat,
      having prohibited his men from plunder or riot, and Captain Bret
      proclaiming that no mischief should be done, they remained tranquil. In
      this way, the insurgents marched, without further interruption, to
      Cornhill, where Wyat marshalled his forces, distributed rations of meat
      and liquors among them, and awaited the appointed time for his attack upon
      the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the fortress all was consternation. The extraordinary success which
      had hitherto attended Wyat, well nigh paralysed the queen's party. The
      council again urged Mary to escape privately, but she peremptorily
      refused, and forbade the subject to be mentioned again, on pain of her
      severest displeasure. Some of the more timid then ventured to advise that
      she should assent to Wyat's terms&mdash;that Renard should be given up,
      and the match with the Prince of Spain abandoned. "I will sooner abandon
      my crown," rejoined Mary. Her courage never for one instant forsook her,
      and her spirit and resolution sustained the wavering minds of her
      adherents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before this, Suffolk and Dudley had reached Dartford. As agreed, the
      duke and his detachment embarked on board Winter's squadron, while the
      others were transported across the river in smaller boats. At Poplar,
      Dudley ordered his men to nail together a number of stout boards, to serve
      as rafts. These were fastened with ropes to such horses as they could
      procure, and on reaching East Smithfield were unharnessed and held in
      readiness, until the signal of attack should be given. Besides the rafts,
      two or three wherries had been brought up from the river, and several long
      scaling-ladders provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley's detachment consisted of about a thousand men, archers and
      arquebussiers, all of whom were well armed and eager for the attack. As
      yet, all was involved in profound darkness, and so far as they could
      judge, no suspicion of their presence was entertained by those within the
      fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scouts were despatched towards the postern gate,&mdash;a fortification
      terminating the city wall, and situated, as has before been stated, at the
      north side of the moat,&mdash;and from one of them, who had contrived to
      scramble along the edge of the fosse, it was ascertained that a detachment
      of Sir Thomas Wyat's party was creeping stealthily along, with the
      intention of surprising the postern gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been Cholmondeley's intention to search for the entrance to the
      secret communication through which he had passed beneath the moat, but the
      almost certainty that it would be stopped, induced him to abandon the
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once, a blaze of light was seen at the south of the fortress, in
      the direction of the river. It was followed bv the roar of artillery, and
      the sharper discharge of fire-arms, accompanied by the beating of drums,
      the loud braying of trumpets, the clashing of swords, and other martial
      sounds.

    <p>
      On hearing this, Dudley gave the signal of assault. Dashing down the sides
      of the moat, his men launched their rafts on the water, and pushed them
      across with long poles. The noise they made betrayed them to the
      sentinels. The alarm was instantly given, and a tremendous fire opened
      upon them from the batteries and casemate of the Brass Mount, as well as
      from the eastern and western line of ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brass Mount has already been described as the largest bastion of the
      Tower, standing at the north-east angle of the fortress, and its walls
      were, and still are, of such immense thickness, and it was so well
      fortified, that it was regarded as impregnable. Notwithstanding this
      impression, it formed the main object of the present attack. Amid a
      slaughterous fire from the besieged, Dudley embarked with Cholmondeloy,
      who carried his standard, in a small skiff, and waving his sword above his
      head, pointed to the Brass Mount, and urged his men to the assault. They
      wanted no encouragement; but in some degree protected by the showers of
      arrows discharged by the archers stationed on the sides of the moat, and
      the constant fire of the arquebussiers, succeeded in placing two ladders
      against that part of the eastern ramparts immediately adjoining the
      bastion.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were instantly covered with men, who mounted sword in hand, but were
      attacked and hurled backwards by the besieged. Another ladder was soon
      planted against the Brass Mount, while two more were reared against the
      northern ramparts opposite the postern gate, which had been stormed and
      taken by Wyat's party, several of whom were descending the banks of the
      moat, and firing upon the fortress, assisted by three culverins placed in
      a temporary battery composed of large baskets filled with sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had not been executed without severe loss on the part of the
      insurgents. Several of the rafts were swamped, and their occupants,
      embarrassed by the weight of their arms, drowned. One of the ladders
      planted against the northern battlements was hurled backwards with its
      living load; and such was the vigour and determination of the besieged,
      that none of the assailants could set a foot on the ramparts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considerable execution, however, was done by the showers of arrows from
      archers, as well as by the discharges of the arquebussiers. But success
      did not, as yet, declare itself for either side. Constantly repulsed, the
      insurgents still resolutely returned to the charge; and though numbers
      fell from the ladders, others were instantly found to take their place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing how matters stood, and aware that some desperate effort must be
      made, Dudley, who had hitherto watched the progress of the fight from the
      moat, exposing himself to the full fire of the batteries, resolved to
      ascend the ladder placed against the Brass Mount. Cholmondeley agreed to
      follow him; and amid the cheers of the assailants and the unrelaxing fire
      of the besieged, the boat was run in to the side of the bastion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, a loud explosion, succeeded by a tremendous shout, was
      heard at the south side of the fortress. For a brief space, both royalists
      and insurgents ceased fighting; and taking advantage of the pause, Dudley
      swiftly mounted the ladder, and reaching the summit, shouted "God save
      Queen Jane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save Queen Jane!" echoed Cholmondeley, who was close behind him. "God
      save Queen Jane!" he repeated, waving the banner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry was reiterated from below, and the firing recommenced more
      furiously than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rumoured among Dudley's men, and the report stimulated their
      ardour, that the Duke of Suffolk had taken Saint Thomas's Tower. This,
      however, was not the case. After the embarkation of the troops as before
      related, the squadron under the command of Admiral Winter, accompanied by
      a number of galleys, and wherries, made its way slowly to the Tower. Owing
      to the necessary delay, the tide had turned, and the larger vessels had to
      be towed up the river by the smaller craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0073" id="linkimage-0073"> </a>

      <a href="images/0398.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      On their arrival they were immediately perceived by the sentinels, who
      opened a fire upon them, which was instantly returned. This was the
      commencement of the siege, and served as the signal to Dudley, and
      likewise to Wyat, of whose movements it will be necessary to speak
      hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the squadron came up, the Duke of Suffolk embarked in a small
      galley, and accompanied by several wherries filled with soldiers,
      contrived, by keeping close under the wall of the wharf, to effect a
      landing, unperceived, at the stairs. Taken by surprise, the guard fell an
      easy prey to their assailants, who seizing the cannon placed there, turned
      them against the fortress.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, several boats landed their crews at the eastern
      end of the wharf, and many others speeded towards it from all quarters. In
      a short time, it was crowded by the insurgents; and notwithstanding the
      tremendous fire kept up against them from the whole line of battlements&mdash;from
      Traitor's Tower&mdash;and from all the fortifications within shot, they
      resolutely maintained their ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directing the attack in person, and exposing himself to every danger, the
      Duke of Suffolk displayed the utmost coolness and courage. The fight raged
      furiously on both sides. Several boats, and one of the larger vessels,
      were sunk by the guns of the batteries, and the ranks of the insurgents
      were greatly thinned. Still there was no symptom of irresolution
      exhibited; nor did they relax for a moment in their efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scaling-ladders were placed against the walls of Traitor's Tower, and
      crowded with climbers, while a gun-boat entered the dark arch beneath it,
      and its crew commenced battering with axes, halberds, and poles, against
      the portcullis and water-gate. Another party had taken possession of the
      buildings opposite the By-ward Tower, and were trying to reach the
      drawbridge, which, it is almost needless to say, was raised. Added to
      these, a strong body of Essex men, having congregated at Limehouse,
      approached the fortress by Saint Catherine's, and the lane leading to the
      Flemish church, and were striving to force the Iron Gate and the eastern
      outlet of the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, an occurrence took place, which, while it disheartened
      the besieged, tended greatly to animate the assailing party. At the
      south-west corner of the wharf stood a row of small habitations separating
      it from Petty Wales. One of these was presently observed to be on fire,
      and the flames rapidly spread to the others. Shortly afterwards, a
      tremendous explosion took place. A building was blown up, and the fiery
      fragments tossed into the river and moat; while across the blazing ruins,
      with loud shouts, rushed a party of men from the troops under Sir Thomas
      Wyat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the explosion that reached the ears of Dudley and his band.
      Rushing to the assistance of their friends, the new-comers seemed
      determined to carry all before them, and such was the effect of their
      sudden appearance, that the besieged for a moment gave way, and a small
      body of the insurgents gained a footing on the roof of Traitor's Tower.
      But the next moment, the royalists rallied, drove off their assailants,
      and the fight continued as obstinately as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sublime but terrific spectacle, and one not easily effaced from
      the remembrance of those who beheld it. The ruddy light cast upon the
      water by the burning houses, and serving to reveal the tall vessels&mdash;the
      armed boats&mdash;the sinking craft and struggling figures with which it
      was covered&mdash;the towers and battlements of the fortress pouring forth
      fire and smoke&mdash;the massive pile of the ancient citadel, which added
      its thunder to the general din,&mdash;the throng of warlike figures
      engaged in active strife on the wharf, or against Traitor's Tower&mdash;constituted
      a scene of intense, though fearful interest&mdash;nor did the roar of the
      cannon, the clash of arms, the shouts and cheers of the combatants and the
      groans of the wounded, detract from its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was yet another scene, which though unwitnessed, except by those
      actually concerned in it equalled, if not surpassed it, in gloomy power.
      This was a conflict under Saint Thomas's Tower. It has been already
      mentioned that a party, manning a gun-boat, had penetrated beneath the
      arch leading to Traitor's Tower, where they endeavoured, with such weapons
      as they possessed, to effect an entrance. While they were thus employed,
      the portcullis was suddenly raised, and the Watergate opened; and the men
      supposing their own party had gained possession of the fortification above
      them, dashed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were speedily undeceived. Before they reached the steps, a number of
      armed figures, some of whom bore torches, appeared, while a thundering
      splash behind told that the portcullis had been let down, so as to cutoff
      their retreat. Nothing remained but to sell their lives as dearly as they
      could. Quarter was neither asked nor granted. Some leaped overboard, and
      tried, sword in hand, to force a way up the steps; others prepared to
      follow them; and the gunner discharged a falconet planted at the prow of
      the boat, occasioning fearful havoc among their opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this availed nothing. They were driven back, and their assailants
      pursuing them into the recesses of the arch, put them to death. The light
      of the few torches that illumined the scene, fell upon figures fearfully
      struggling, while the arches rang with the reports of musquetry, groans,
      and curses. In a short time, all was still and dark as heretofore. But
      when the watersgate was afterwards opened, fourteen mangled corpses
      floated out to the Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the siege was thus vigorously carried on, on the north and south,
      the western side of the fortress was not neglected. Remaining at Cornhill
      for some hours, Wyat divided his forces into two detachments, and
      committed one to Captain Bret, whom he directed to proceed to the upper
      part of Tower Hill, along Lombard-street, Fenchurch-street, and
      Tower-street, and to place his men within the churchyard of All-Hallows
      Barking, and at the rear of the scaffold on Tower Hill; while with the
      other he himself marched down Gracechurch-street, along Thames-street,
      taking up a position before the Bulwark Gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had reached this point, and arranged his men, he rode off to
      Bret, and ordered a party, commanded by Captain Cobliam, to attack the
      postern-gate, as before related. Bret was to hold himself in readiness to
      march down to the Bulwark Gate, or to attack the Leg Mount, a bastion at
      the north-west angle of the fortress, corresponding (though of somewhat
      smaller size,) with the Brass Mount, as he should receive instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having issued these directions, Wyat rode back to his troops&mdash;he was
      now mounted, as were several of his officers, on the steeds captured in
      the recent skirmish with the Earl of Pembroke&mdash;and commanded them to
      remain perfectly quiet till Admiral Winter's squadron should arrive off
      the Tower. His injunctions were strictly obeyed, and such perfect silence
      was observed, that though his men were drawn up within a few yards of the
      fortress, they were not discovered by the sentinels.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the arrival of the squadron, Wyat immediately commenced an attack upon
      the Bulwark Gate&mdash;one of the weakest outworks of the fortress,&mdash;and
      while directing his engines against it, some half-dozen wooden houses
      adjoining it on the side of the moat, were fired by his men; and the
      flames quickly extending to the buildings immediately contiguous to the
      Bulwark Gate, that defence was at once surrendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first point gained, Wyat despatched a messenger to Bret ordering him
      to join him instantly; and while a handful of his men, rushing round the
      semicircular wall, heretofore described as protecting the lesser moat,
      attacked the embattled gateway fronting the Lion's Tower, with the
      intention of joining Suffolk's party on the wharf, he directed his main
      force against the Lion's Gate. This fortification was stoutly defended,
      and the insurgents were twice repulsed before they could bring their
      engines to bear against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bret and his party having arrived, such an irresistible attack was made
      upon the gate, that in a short time it was carried. With loud shouts, the
      insurgents drove the royalists before them along the narrow bridge facing
      the Lion's Tower, and leading to the Middle Tower, putting some to the
      sword, and throwing others over the walls into the moat.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0402.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The movement was so expeditious, and the rout so unexpected, that the
      portcullis of the Middle Tower, which was kept up to allow the flying men
      to pass through it, could not be lowered, and hastily directing those
      around him to prop it up with a piece of timber, Wyat continued the
      pursuit to the By-ward. Tower.

    <p>
      Hitherto, complete success had attended his efforts; and if he had passed
      the fortification he was approaching, in all probability he would have
      been master of the Tower. Nothing doubting this, he urged his men onwards.
      On his left rode Bret, and behind them, at a short distance, came Captain
      Knevet, and two other leaders, likewise on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they arrived within a few paces of the By-ward Tower, three tremendous
      personages issued from it, and opposed their further progress. They were
      equipped in corslets of polished steel and morions; and two of them were
      armed with bucklers and enormous maces, while the third wielded a partizan
      of equal size. These, it is almost needless to state, were the three
      giants. The bearer of the partizan was Gog. Behind them came their
      diminutive attendant, who, it appeared, had been released from his
      thraldom, particulars of which, and of his adventures subsequent to his
      meeting with Cicely in the cell beneath the Salt Tower, will be related at
      a more convenient opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like his gigantic companions, Xit was fully armed, in a steel corslet,
      cuisses, and gauntlets. His head was sheltered by a helmet, shaded by an
      immense plume of feathers, which, being considerably too large for him,
      almost eclipsed his features. He was furthermore provided with a sword
      almost as long as himself, and a buckler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking care to keep under the shelter of the giants, Xit strutted about,
      and brandishing his sword in a valiant manner, shouted, or rather
      screamed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon them Og!&mdash;attack them Gog!&mdash;why do you stand still, Magog?
      Let me pass, and I will show you how you should demean yourselves in the
      fight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of the giants, the flying royalists rallied, and a fierce but
      ineffectual struggle took place. During it, Bret was dismounted and thrown
      into the moat. Urged by their leader, the insurgents pressed furiously
      forward. But the giants presented an impassable barrier. Og plied his mace
      with as much zeal as he did the clubs when he enacted the part of the
      Tower at Courtenay's masque, and with far more terrible effect. All
      avoided the sweep of his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content with dealing blows, he dashed among the retreating foe, and
      hurled some dozen of them into the moat. His prowess excited universal
      terror and astonishment. Nor was Gog much behind him. Wherever his
      partizan descended, a foe fell beneath its weight; and as he was
      incessantly whirling it over his head, and bringing it down, a space was
      speedily cleared before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the havoc occasioned by the gigantic brethren, and finding that
      they completely checked his further advance, Wyat struck spurs into his
      charger, and dashing upon Magog, tried to hew him down. If the married
      giant had not caught the blow aimed at him upon his shield, Dame Placida
      had been made a widow for the second time. Again plunging the spurs
      rowel-deep into his horse's flanks, Wyat would have ridden over his
      gigantic antagonist, if the latter, perceiving his intention, had not
      raised his mace, and with one tremendous blow smashed the skull of the
      noble animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yield you, Sir Thomas Wyat," cried Magog, rushing up to the knight, who
      was borne to the ground with his slaughtered charger&mdash;"you are my
      prisoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back, caitiff!" cried Wyat, disengaging himself and attacking the giant;
      "I will never yield with life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wyat, however, would have been speedily captured by the giant, if Knevet,
      seeing his perilous situation, had not pressed forward with several others
      to his assistance, and rescued him. This accident, however, enabled the
      retreating party to pass beneath the archway of the By-ward Tower, the
      portcullis of which was instantly lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, a body of the insurgents having taken possession of the Middle
      Tower, had planted themselves at the various loop-holes, and on the roof,
      and kept up a constant fire on the soldiers stationed on the summit of the
      By-Ward Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who contrived to distinguish themselves in the action was Xit.
      Finding his position one of more danger than he had anticipated, he
      scrambled upon the wall on the right of the By-ward Tower, where, being
      out of the rush, he could defy at his ease those who were swimming in the
      moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was in this situation, Bret, who, it has been mentioned, was
      thrown into the moat, swam to the wall, and endeavoured to ascend it. Xit
      immediately attacked him, and adopting the language of Magog to Wyat,
      threatened to throw him back again if he did not yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do yield,'" replied Bret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name and rank?" demanded the dwarf, in an authoritative tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alexander Bret, captain of the London Trained Bands, second in command to
      Sir Thomas Wyat," replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, Magog&mdash;Gog&mdash;Og&mdash;help!" shouted Xit&mdash;"I have
      taken a prisoner. It is Captain Bret, one of the rebel leaders&mdash;help
      him out of the moat, and let us carry him before the queen! I am certain
      to be knighted for my valour. Mind, <i>I</i> have taken him. He has
      yielded to me. No one else has had a hand in his capture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, Magog pulled Bret out of the moat. As soon as he
      ascertained who he was, he bore him in his arms towards the By-Ward Tower&mdash;Xit
      keeping near them all the time, screaming, "he is <i>my</i> prisoner. You
      have nothing to do with it. I shall certainly be knighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      At Magog's command, the portcullis was partially raised, and Xit and Bret
      thrust under it, while the two other giants repelled the assailants.

      XXX.&mdash;HOW QUEEN MARY COMPORTED HERSELF DURING THE SIEGE; HOW LORD
      GUILFORD DUDLEY WAS CAPTURED; AND HOW SIR THOMAS WYAT AND THE DUKE OF
      SUFFOLK WERE ROUTED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hroughout the
      whole of the siege, the queen maintained her accustomed firmness; and to
      her indomitable courage, and the effect produced by it upon her followers,
      the successful issue of the conflict to the royalist party is mainly to be
      attributed. Startled from her slumbers by the roar of the artillery, Mary
      arose, and hastily arraying herself, quitted the palace with Gardiner,
      Renard, and a few other attendants, who had flown to her on the first
      rumour of the attack, and repaired to the lieutenant's lodgings, where she
      found Sir Henry Bedingfeld in the entrance hall, surrounded by armed men,
      busied in giving them instructions, and despatching messages to the
      officers in command of the different fortifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the queen's appearance, the old knight would have flung himself at her
      feet, but she motioned him not to heed her, and contented herself with
      saying, as each messenger departed:&mdash;"Tell my soldiers, that I will
      share their danger. I will visit every fortification in turn, and I doubt
      not I shall find its defenders at their posts. No courageous action shall
      pass unrequited: and as I will severely punish these rebels, so I will
      reward those who signalise themselves in their defeat. Bid them fight for
      their queen&mdash;for the daughter of the Eighth Henry, whose august
      spirit is abroad to watch over and direct them. He who brings me Wyat's
      head, shall receive knighthood at my hands, together with the traitor's
      forfeited estates. Let this be proclaimed. And now fight&mdash;and
      valiantly&mdash;for you fight for the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charged with animating addresses like these, the soldiers hurried to their
      various leaders. The consequence may be easily imagined. Aware that they
      were under the immediate eye of their sovereign, and anticipating her
      coming each moment, the men, eager to distinguish themselves, fought with
      the utmost ardour; and such was the loyalty awakened by Mary's energy and
      spirit, that even those secretly inclined towards the opposite party, of
      whom there were not a few, did not dare to avow their real sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mary remained in the lieutenant's lodgings, word was brought that
      the fortress was attacked on all sides, and the thunder of the ordnance
      now resounding from the whole line of ramparts, and answered by the guns
      of the besiegers, confirmed the statement. As she heard these tidings, and
      listened to the fearful tumult without, her whole countenance underwent a
      change; and those who remembered her kingly sire, recognised his most
      terrible expression, and felt the same awe they had formerly experienced
      in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that I had been born a man!" she cried, "that with my own hand I
      might punish these traitors. But they shall find though they have a woman
      to deal with, they have no feeble and faint-hearted antagonist. I cannot
      wield a sword; but I will stand by those who can. Sir Henry Bedingfeld,
      take these orders from me, and they are final. Let the siege go how it
      may, I will make no terms with the rebels, nor hold further parley with
      them. Show them no quarter&mdash;exterminate them utterly. I no longer
      regard them as subjects&mdash;children; but as aliens&mdash;foes. Deal
      with them as such. And look you yield not this fortress&mdash;for by God's
      grace! <i>I</i> never will yield it. Where is your own post, Sir Henry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the By-ward Tower, your highness," replied Bedingfeld. "The traitor
      Wyat directs the attack in that quarter; and he is most to be feared of
      all our opponents. I will not quit the fortification with my life. But who
      shall succeed me, if I fall?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The queen," replied Mary. "But you will <i>not</i> fall, good Bedingfeld.
      You are appointed by Heaven to be my preserver. Go to your post; and keep
      it, in my name. Go, and fight for your royal mistress, and for the holy
      Catholic faith which we both of us profess, and which these rebels&mdash;these
      heretics, would overthrow. Go, and the Virgin prosper you, and strengthen
      your arm.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "I obey your majesty," replied Bedingfeld; "and yet I cannot but feel that
      my place is by your side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! do you loiter, sir?" cried Mary fiercely. "You have tarried here too
      long already. Do you not hear yon loud-voiced cannon summon you hence? Are
      you deaf to those cries? To your post, sir&mdash;and quit it not for your
      head. Stay!" she added, as the knight was about to obey her. "I meant not
      this. I have been over-hasty. But you will bear with me. Go. I have no
      fears&mdash;and have much to do. Success be with you. We meet again as
      victors, or we meet no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall meet ere day-break," replied the knight. And quitting the
      presence, he hurried to the By-ward Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In case fate declares itself against your highness, and the insurgents
      win the fortress," observed Renard, "I can convey you beyond their reach.
      I am acquainted with a subterranean passage communicating with the further
      side of the moat, and have stationed a trusty guard at its entrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the event your excellency anticipates," returned Mary, sternly, "but
      which I am assured will never occur, I will not fly. While one stone of
      that citadel stands upon another it shall never be surrendered: and while
      life remains to her, Mary of England will never desert it. In your next
      despatch to the prince your master, tell him his proposed consort proved
      herself worthy&mdash;in resolution, at least&mdash;of the alliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will report your intrepid conduct to the prince," replied Renard. "But
      I would, for his sake, if not for your own, gracious madam, that you would
      not further expose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the ramparts!" cried Mary, disregarding him. "Let those follow me, who
      are not afraid to face these traitors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quitting the entrance-hall, she mounted a broad staircase of carved oak,
      and traversing a long gallery, entered a passage leading to the Bell Tower&mdash;a
      fortification already described as standing on the west of the
      lieutenant's lodgings, and connected with them. The room to which the
      passage brought her, situated on the upper story, and now used as part of
      the domestic offices of the governor, was crowded with soldiers, busily
      employed in active defensive preparations. Some were discharging their
      calivers through the loopholes at the besiegers, while others were
      carrying ammunition to the roof of the building..
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing a few words of encouragement to them, and, crossing the room,
      Mary commanded an officer to conduct her to the walls. Seeing from her
      manner that remonstrance would be useless, the officer obeyed. As she
      emerged from the low arched doorway opening upon the ballimn wall, the
      range of wooden houses on the opposite side of the moat burst into flames,
      and the light of the conflagration, while it revealed the number of her
      enemies and their plan of attack, rendered her situation infinitely more
      perilous, inasmuch as it betrayed her to general observation. Directed by
      the shouts, the besiegers speedily discovered the occasion of the clamour;
      and though Sir Thomas Wyat, who was engaged at the moment in personally
      directing the assault on the Bulwark Gate, commanded his men to cease
      firing in that quarter, his injunctions were wholly disregarded, and
      several shots struck the battlements close to the queen. Seriously
      alarmed, Gardiner earnestly entreated her to retire, but she peremptorily
      refused, and continued her course as slowly as if no danger beset her&mdash;ever
      and anon pausing to watch the movements of the besiegers, or to encourage
      and direct her own-men. Before she reached the Beauchamp Tower, the
      Bulwark Gate was carried, and the triumphant shouts of the insurgents drew
      from her an exclamation of bitter anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is but a small advantage gained, your highness," remarked the officer;
      "they will be speedily repulsed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Small as it is, sir," rejoined the queen, "I would rather have-lost the
      richest jewel from my crown than they had gained so much. Look! they are
      gathering together before the Lion's Gate. They are thundering against it
      with sledge-hammers, battering-rams, and other engines. I can hear the din
      of their blows above all this tumult. And see! other troops are advancing
      to their aid. By their banners and white coats, I know they are the London
      trained-bands, headed by Bret. Heaven confound the traitor! He who will
      bring him to me dead or alive, shall have whatever he asks. Ah, God's
      death! they have forced the Lion's Gate&mdash;they drive all before them.
      Recreants! why do you not dispute it inch by inch, and you may regain what
      you have lost? Confusion! Wyat and his rebel band press onward, and the
      others fly. They pass through the Middle Tower. Ah! that shout, those
      fearful cries! They put my faithful subjects to the sword. They are in
      possession of the Middle Tower, and direct its guns on the By-ward Tower.
      Wyat and his band are on the bridge. They press forward, the others
      retreat. Retreat! ah, caitiffs, cowards that you are, you <i>must</i>
      fight now, if you have a spark of loyalty left. They fly. They have
      neither loyalty nor valour. Where is Bedingfeld?&mdash;where is my
      lieutenant? why does he not sally forth upon them? If I were there, I
      would myself lead the attack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty's desires are fulfilled," remarked the officer; "a sally is
      made by a party from the gate&mdash;the rebels are checked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see it!" exclaimed the queen, joyfully&mdash;"but what valiant men are
      they who thus turn the tide? Ah! I know them now, they are my famous
      giants&mdash;my loyal warders. Look how the rebel ranks are cleared by the
      sweep of their mighty arms. Brave yeomen! you have fought as no belted
      knights have hitherto fought, and have proved the truth of your royal
      descent. Ah! Wyat is down. Slay him! spare him not, brave giant! his
      lands, his title are yours. Heaven's curse upon him, the traitor has
      escaped! I can bear this no longer." she added, turning to her conductor.
      "Lead on: I would see what they are doing elsewhere." The command was
      obeyed, but the officer had not proceeded many yards when a shot struck
      him, and he fell mortally wounded at the queen's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear you are hurt, sir," said Mary, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To death, madam," gasped the officer. "I should not care to die, had I
      lived to see you victorious. When all others were clamouring for the
      usurper Jane, my voice was raised for you, my rightful queen; and now my
      last shout shall be for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name?" demanded Mary, bending over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gilbert," replied the officer&mdash;"I am the grandson of Gunora Braose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Live, Gilbert," rejoined Mary&mdash;"live for my sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising himself upon one arm, with a dying effort, Gilbert waved his sword
      over his head, and cried, "God save Queen Mary, and confusion to her
      enemies!" And with these words, he fell backwards, and instantly expired.
      The queen gazed for a moment wistfully at the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it," she mused, as she suffered herself to be led onward by
      Renard, "that, when hundreds of my subjects are perishing around me, this
      man's death should affect me so strongly?&mdash;I know not. Yet, so it
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her attention, however, was speedily attracted to other matters. Passing
      through the Beauchamp Tower, she proceeded to the next fortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main attacks of the besiegers, as has been previously stated, were
      directed against the Brass Mount, Saint Thomas's Tower, and the By-ward
      Tower;&mdash;the western and north-western ramparts, including the Leg
      Mount, a large bastion corresponding with the Brass Mount, being
      comparatively unmolested, faking up a position on the roof of the Devilin
      Tower, which flanked the north-west angle of the ballium wall, Mary
      commanded two sides of the fortress, and the view on either hand was
      terrific and sublime. On the left, the blazing habitations, which being of
      highly-combustible material were now, in a great measure, consumed, cast a
      red and lurid glare on the moat, lighting up the ramparts, the
      fortifications behind them, and those on the bridge,&mdash;two of which,
      she was aware, were in the possession of the besiegers. In this quarter
      the firing had ceased; and it seemed that both parties had by mutual
      consent suspended hostilities, to renew them in a short time with greater
      animosity than ever. On the right, however, the assault continued with
      unabated fury. A constant fire was kept up from the temporary batteries
      placed before the postern gate; clouds of arrows whizzed through the air,
      shot by the archers stationed on the banks of the moat; and another ladder
      having been placed against the ramparts, several of the scaling party had
      obtained a footing, and were engaged hand to hand with the besieged. Ever
      and anon, amid this tumultuous roar was heard a loud splash, proclaiming
      that some miserable wretch had been hurled into the moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      After contemplating the spectacle for some time in silence, Mary proceeded
      to the Flint Tower&mdash;a fortification about ninety feet nearer the
      scene of strife. Here the alarming intelligence was brought her that Lord
      Guilford Dudley was in possession of the Brass Mount, and that other
      advantages had been gained by the insurgents in that quarter. The fight
      raged so fiercely, it was added, that it would be tempting Providence in
      her majesty to proceed further. Yielding, at length, to the solicitations
      of her attendants, Mary descended from the walls, and shaped her course
      towards the White Tower; while Renard, by her command, hastened to the
      Martin Tower (now the Jewel Tower) to ascertain how matters stood. His
      first step was to ascend the roof of this structure, which, standing
      immediately behind the Brass Mount, completely overlooked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be borne in mind that the Tower is surrounded by a double line of
      defences, and that the ballium wall and its fortifications are much
      loftier than the outer ramparts. Renard found the roof of the Martin Tower
      thronged with soldiers, who were bringing their guns to bear upon the
      present possessors of the Brass Mount. They were assisted in their efforts
      to dislodge them by the occupants of the Brick Tower and the Constable
      Tower; and notwithstanding the advantage gained by the insurgents, they
      sustained severe loss from the constant fire directed against them.
      Bernard's glance sought out Lord Guilford Dudley; and after a few moments'
      search, guided by the shouts, he perceived him with Cholmondeley driving a
      party of royalists before him down the steps leading to the eastern
      ramparts. Here he was concealed from view, and protected by the roofs of a
      range of habitations from the guns on the ballium wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments afterwards, intelligence was conveyed by the soldiers on the
      Broad Arrow Tower to those on the Constable Tower, and thence from
      fortification to fortification, that Dudley having broken into one of the
      houses covering the ramparts, was descending with his forces into the
      eastern ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard saw that not a moment was to be lost. Ordering the soldiers not to
      relax their fire for an instant, he put himself at the head of a body of
      men, and hurrying down a spiral stone-staircase, which brought him to a
      subterranean chamber, unlocked a door in it, and traversing with lightning
      swiftness a long narrow passage, speedily reached another vaulted room. At
      first no outlet was perceptible; but snatching a torch from one of his
      band, Renard touched a knob of iron in the wall, and a stone dropping from
      its place discovered a flight of steps, up which they mounted. These
      brought them to a wider passage, terminated by a strong door clamped with
      iron, and forming a small sally-port opening upon the eastern ward, a
      little lower down than Lord Guilford Dudley and his party had gained
      admittance to it. Commanding his men to obey his injunctions implicitly,
      Renard flung open the sally-port, and dashed through it at their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley was pressing forward in the direction of the Iron Gate when Renard
      appeared. Both parties were pretty equally matched in point of number,
      though neither leader could boast more than twenty followers. Still,
      multitudes were hastening to them from every quarter. A detachment of
      royalists were issuing from a portal near the Salt Tower; while a host of
      insurgents were breaking through the house lately forced by Lord Guilford
      Dudley, and hurrying to his assistance. In a few seconds, the opposing
      parties met. By the light of the torches, Dudley recognized Renard; and,
      uttering a shout of exultation, advanced to the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as it was known to the insurgents that the abhorred Spanish
      ambassador was before them, with one accord they turned their weapons
      against him, and if their leader had not interposed, would have inevitably
      slain him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave him to me," cried Dudley, "and I will deliver my country from this
      detested traitor. Fellow soldiers," he added, addressing Renard's
      companions, "will you fight for Spain, for the Inquisition, for the
      idolatries of Rome, when swords are drawn for your country&mdash;and for
      the Reformed religion? We are come to free you from the yoke under which
      you labour. Join us, and fight for your liberties, your laws,&mdash;for
      the gospel, and for Queen Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, fight for Jane, and the gospel!" shouted Cholmondeley. "Down with
      Renard and the See of Rome. No Spanish match! no Inquisition!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you fighting for? Who is your leader?" continued Dudley;&mdash;"a
      base Spanish traitor. Who are you fighting against?&mdash;Englishmen, your
      friends, your countrymen, your brothers&mdash;members of the same faith,
      of the same family."
    </p>
    <p>
      This last appeal proved effectual. Most of the royalists went over to the
      insurgents, shouting, "No Spanish match! no Inquisition! Down with
      Renard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, down with Renard!" cried Dudley. "I will no longer oppose your just
      vengeance. Slay him, and we will fix his head upon a spear. It will serve
      to strike terror into our enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in this extremity, Renard's constitutional bravery did not desert
      him; and, quickly retreating, he placed his back against the wall. The few
      faithful followers who stood by him, endeavoured to defend him, but they
      were soon slain, and he could only oppose his single sword against the
      array of partizans and pikes raised against him. His destruction appeared
      inevitable, and he had already given himself up for lost, when a rescue
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detachment of soldiers, headed by Sir Thomas Brydges, already
      described as issuing from the gate near the Salt Tower, seeing a skirmish
      taking place, hurried forward, and reached the scene of strife just in
      time to save the ambassador, whose assailants were compelled to quit him
      to wield their weapons in their own defence. Thus set free, Renard sprang
      like a tiger upon his foes, and, aided by the new-comers, occasioned
      fearful havoc among them. But his deadliest fury was directed against
      those who had deserted him, and he spared none of them whom he could reach
      with his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Guilford Dudley and his esquire performed prodigies of valour. The
      former made many efforts to reach Renard, but, such was the confusion
      around him, that he was constantly foiled in his purpose. At length,
      seeing it was in vain to contend against such superior force, and that his
      men would be speedily cut in pieces, and himself captured, he gave the
      word to retreat, and fled towards the north-east angle of the ward. The
      royalists started after them; but such was the speed at which the
      fugitives ran, that they could not overtake them. A few stragglers
      ineffectually attempted to check their progress, and the soldiers on the
      walls above did not dare to fire upon them, for fear of injuring their own
      party. In this way, they passed the Martin Tower, and were approaching the
      Brick Tower, when a large detachment of soldiers were seen advancing
      towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long live Queen Jane!" shouted Dudley and his companions, vainly hoping
      they were friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long live Queen Mary, and death to the rebels!" responded the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cry, Dudley and his little band halted. They were hemmed in on all
      sides, without the possibility of escape; and the royalists on the
      fortifications above being now able to mark them, opened a devastating
      fire upon them. By this time, Renard and his party had turned the angle of
      the wall, and the voice of the ambassador was heard crying&mdash;"Cut them
      in pieces! Spare no one but their leader. Take him alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hearing the shout, Dudley observed to Cholmondeley&mdash;"You have ever
      been my faithful esquire, and I claim one last service from you. If I am
      in danger of being taken, slay me. I will not survive defeat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, my lord, live," cried Cholmondeley. "Wyat or the Duke of Suffolk may
      be victorious, and deliver you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Dudley, "I will not run the risk of being placed again in
      Mary's power. Obey my last injunctions. Should you escape, fly to Jane.
      You know where to find her. Bid her embark instantly for France, and say
      her husband with his last breath blessed her."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, he was interrupted by Cholmondeley, who pointed out an
      open door in the ramparts opposite them. Eagerly availing himself of the
      chance, Dudley called to his men to follow him, and dashed through it,
      uncertain whither it led, but determined to sell his life dearly. The
      doorway admitted them into a low vaulted chamber, in which were two or
      three soldiers and a stand of arms and ammunition. The men fled at their
      approach along a dark, narrow passage, and endeavoured to fasten an inner
      door, but the others were too close upon them to permit it. As Dudley and
      his band advanced, they found themselves at the foot of a short flight of
      steps, and rushing up them, entered a semi-circular passage, about six
      feet wide, with a vaulted roof, and deep embrazures in the walls, in which
      cannon were planted. It was, in fact, the casemate of the Brass Mount. By
      the side of the cannon stood the gunners, and the passage was filled with
      smoke. Alarmed by the cries of their companions, and the shouts of Dudley
      and his band, these men, who were in utter ignorance of what had passed,
      except that they had been made aware that the summit of the bastion was
      carried, threw down their arms, and sued for quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it, friends," cried Dudley, "provided you will fight for
      Queen Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed!" replied the gunners. "Long live Queen Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand by me," returned Dudley, "and these stout walls shall either prove
      our safeguard, or our tomb."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gunners then saw how matters stood, but they could not retract; and
      they awaited a favourable opportunity to turn against their new masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving the course taken by Dudley and his companions, Henard felt
      certain of their capture, and repeated his injunctions to the soldiers to
      take him alive if possible, but on no account to suffer him to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dudley, meanwhile, endeavoured with Cholmondeley to drag one of the large
      pieces of ordnance out of the embrasure in which it was placed, with the
      view of pointing it against their foes. But before this could be
      accomplished, the attack commenced. Darting to the head of the steps,
      Dudley valiantly defended the pass for some time; and the royalist
      soldiers, obedient to the injunctions of Renard, forbore to strike him,
      and sought only his capture. The arched roof rang with the clash of
      weapons, with the reports of shot, and with the groans of the wounded and
      dying. The floor beneath them soon became slippery with blood. Still,
      Dudley kept his ground. All at once, he staggered, and fell. A blow had
      been dealt him from behind by one of the gunners, who had contrived to
      approach him unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is over," he groaned to his esquire, "finish me, and fly, if you can,
      to Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley raised his sword to comply with his lord's injunctions, but
      the blow was arrested by the strong arm of Renard, who bestriding his
      prey, cried, in a voice of exultation, "He is mine! Bear him to the Queen
      before he expires."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondelcy heard no more, but darting backwards, sprang into the
      embrazure whence he had endeavoured to drag the cannon, and forcing
      himself through the aperture, dropped from the dizzy height into the moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Mary proceeded to Saint John's-Chapel in the White
      Tower. It was brilliantly illuminated, and high mass was being performed
      by Bonner and the whole of the priesthood assembled within the fortress.
      The transition from the roar and tumult without to this calm and sacred
      scene was singularly striking, and calculated to produce a strong effect
      on the feelings. There, all was strife and clamour; the air filled with
      smoke was almost stifling; and such places as were not lighted up by the
      blaze of the conflagration or the flashing of the ordnance and musquetry,
      were buried in profound gloom. Here, all was light, odour, serenity,
      sanctity. Without, fierce bands were engaged in deathly fight&mdash;nothing
      was heard but the clash of arms, the thunder of cannon, the shouts of the
      victorious, the groans of the dying. Within, holy men were celebrating
      their religious rites, undisturbed by the terrible struggle around them,
      and apparently unconscious of it; tapers shone from every pillar; the
      atmosphere was heavy with incense; and the choral, hymn mingled with the
      scarce-heard roar of cannon. Mary was so affected by the scene, that for
      the first time she appeared moved. Her bosom heaved, and a tear started to
      her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How peaceful is the holy place," she observed to Gardiner, "and what a
      contrast it presents to the scene we have just quitted! I could almost
      wish that Heaven had destined me to the cloister instead of the throne,
      that I might pass my days in the exercise of my religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven has destined you to be the restorer and defender of our religion,
      madam," replied Gardiner. "Had you not been called to the high station you
      occupy, the Catholic worship, so long discontinued in these holy walls,
      would not now be celebrated. To you we owe its restoration;&mdash;to you
      we must owe its continuance."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mary advanced to the altar, the anthem ceased, and silence prevailed
      throughout the sacred structure. Prostrating herself, she prayed for a few
      moments fervently, and in an audible voice. She then arose, and observed
      to Gardiner, "I feel so much comforted, that I am assured Heaven will
      support me and our holy religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, solemn music resounded through the chapel, the anthem was
      again chanted, and the priests resumed their holy rites. With a heart
      strengthened and elated, Mary ascended the staircase behind the altar, and
      passing through the gallery proceeded to the council-chamber, where she
      was informed that Xit, having captured a prisoner of importance, waited
      without to ascertain her pleasure concerning him. Mary ordered the dwarf
      to be brought into her presence with his captive, and in a few moments he
      was introduced with Bret, who was guarded by a couple of halberdiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On no previous occasion had Xit exhibited so much consequence as the
      present, and his accoutrements and fantastically-plumed casque added to
      his ludicrous appearance. He advanced slowly and majestically towards the
      chair of state in which Mary was seated, ever and anon turning his head to
      see that Bret was close behind him, and when within a short distance of
      the royal person, he made a profound salutation. Unluckily, in doing so,
      his helmet fell from his head, and rolled to the queen's feet. Slightly
      discomposed by the accident, and still more by Mary's frowns, he picked up
      his helmet, and stammered forth,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am come to inform your highness that I have taken a prisoner&mdash;taken
      him with my own hands&mdash;&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it?" interrupted Mary, glancing sternly at the captive, who
      remained with his arms folded upon his breast, and his eyes cast upon the
      floor. "Who is it?" she asked, in an imperious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The arch-traitor Bret," answered Xit,&mdash;"the captain of the London
      Trained Bands, who revolted from the Duke of Norfolk, and joined the
      rebels at Rochester."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bret!" ejaculated Mary, in a tone that made Xit recoil several steps with
      fright, while the prisoner himself looked up. "Aha! is the traitor then
      within our power? Take him without, and let the headsman deal with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness!" cried Bret, prostrating himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away with him!" interrupted Mary. "Do you, my lord," she added, to
      Gardiner, "see that my commands are obeyed." The prisoner was accordingly
      removed, and Xit, who was completely awed by the queen's furious looks,
      was about to slink off, when she commanded him to remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay!" she cried. "I have promised on my queenly word, that whoso brought
      this traitor Bret to me, should have whatever he demanded. Art thou in
      good truth his captor? Take heed thou triflest not with me. I am in no
      mood for jesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I perceive, gracious madam," replied Xit. "But I swear to you, I took
      him with my own hand, in fair and open combat. My companion Magog, if he
      survives the fray, will vouch for the truth of my statement&mdash;nay,
      Bret himself will not gainsay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bret will gainsay little more," rejoined Mary sternly; "his brain will
      contrive no further treason against us, nor his tongue give utterance to
      it. But I believe thee&mdash;the rather that I am persuaded thou darest
      not deceive me. Make thy request&mdash;it is granted.".
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I dared to raise my hopes so high," said Xit, bashfully "What means
      the knave?" cried Mary. "I have said the request shall be granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever I ask?" inquired Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever thou mayest ask in reason, sirrah!" returned Mary, somewhat
      perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," replied Xit, "I should have claimed a dukedom. But as your
      highness might possibly think the demand unreasonable, I will limit myself
      to knighthood."
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of herself, Mary could not repress a smile at the dwarf's
      extravagant request, and the terms in which it was couched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have made many efforts to obtain this distinction," pursued Xit,&mdash;"and
      for a while unsuccessfully. But fortune, or rather my bravery, has at
      length favoured me. I desire knighthood at your Majesty's hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thou shalt have it," replied Mary; "and it will be a lesson to me to make
      no rash promises in future. Hereafter, when affairs are settled, thou wilt
      not fail to remind me of my promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness may depend upon it, I will not fail to do so," replied Xit,
      bowing and retiring. "Huzza!" he cried, as soon as he gained the
      antechamber. "Huzza!" he repeated, skipping in the air, and cutting as
      many capers as his armour would allow him, "at length, I have reached the
      height of my ambition. I shall be knighted. The queen has promised it.
      Aha! my three noble giants, I am now a taller man than any of you. My
      lofty title will make up for my want of stature. Sir Xit!&mdash;that does
      not sound well. I must change my name for one more euphonious, or at least
      find out my surname. Who am I? It is strange I never thought of tracing
      out my history before. I feel I am of illustrious origin. I must clear up
      this point before I am knighted. Stand aside, base grooms," he continued
      to the grinning and jeering attendants, "and let me pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      While pushing through them, a sudden bustle was heard behind, and he was
      very unceremoniously thrust back by Simon Renard, who was conducting
      Dudley to the queen's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another prisoner!" exclaimed Xit. "I wonder what Renard will get for his
      pains. If I could but take Wyat, my fortune were indeed made. First, I
      will go and see what has become of Bret; and then, if I can do so without
      much risk, I will venture outside the portcullis of the By-ward Tower. Who
      knows but I may come in for another good thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus communing with himself, Xit went in search of the unfortunate captain
      of the Trained Bands, while Renard entered the council-chamber with
      Dudley. The latter, though faint from loss of blood, on finding himself in
      the queen's presence, exerted all his strength, and stood erect and
      unsupported.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far your highness is victorious," said Renard; "one of the
      rebel-leaders is in your power, and ere long all will be so: Will it
      please you to question him&mdash;or shall I bid Mauger take off his head
      at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me reflect a moment," replied Mary, thoughtfully, "He shall die," she
      added, after a pause; "but not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It were better to behead him now," rejoined Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not think so," replied Mary. "Let him be removed to some place of
      safe confinement&mdash;the dungeon beneath Saint John's Chapel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only grace I ask from your highness is speedy death," said Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore I will not grant it," replied Mary. "No, traitor! you shall
      perish with your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed Dudley, "I have destroyed her."
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the words were pronounced, he reeled backwards, and would have
      fallen, if the attendants had not caught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your Majesty has spared Mauger a labour," observed Renard, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is not dead," replied Mary; "and if he were so, it would not grieve
      me. Remove him; and do with him as I have commanded."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her injunctions were obeyed, and the inanimate body of Dudley was carried
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard was proceeding to inform the queen that the insurgents had been
      driven from the Brass Mount, when a messenger arrived, with tidings that
      another success had been gained&mdash;Sir Henry Jerningham having
      encountered the detachment under the Duke of Suffolk, and driven them back
      to their vessels, was about to assist the Earl of Pembroke and Sir Henry
      Bedingfeld in a sally upon Sir Thomas Wyat's party. This news so enchanted
      Mary, that she took a valuable ring from her finger and presented it to
      the messenger, saying&mdash;"I will double thy fee, good fellow, if thou
      wilt bring me word that Wyat is slain, and his traitorous band utterly
      routed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the messenger departed, when another appeared. He brought
      word that several vessels had arrived off the Tower, and attacked the
      squadron under the command of Admiral Winter; that all the vessels, with
      the exception of one, on board which the Duke of Suffolk had taken refuge,
      had struck; and that her majesty might now feel assured of a speedy
      conquest. At this news, Mary immediately fell on her knees, and cried&mdash;"I
      thank thee, O Lord! not that thou hast vouchsafed me a victory over my
      enemies, but that thou hast enabled me to triumph over thine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next tidings your highness receives will be that the siege is
      raised," observed Renard, as the queen arose; "and, with your permission,
      I will be the messenger to bring it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," replied Mary. "I would now gladly be alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Renard issued from the principal entrance of the White
    </p>
    <p>
      Tower, and was about to cross the Green, he perceived a small group
      collected before Saint Peter's Chapel, and at once guessing its meaning,
      he hastened towards it. It was just beginning to grow light, and objects
      could be imperfectly distinguished. As Renard drew nigh, he perceived a
      circle formed round a soldier whose breast-plate, doublet, and ruff had
      been removed, and who was kneeling with his arms crossed upon his breast
      beside a billet of wood. Near him, on the left, stood Manger, with his axe
      upon his shoulder, and on the right, Gardiner holding a crucifix towards
      him, and earnestly entreating him to die in the faith of Rome; promising
      him, in case of compliance, a complete remission of his sins. Bret, for he
      it was, made no answer, but appeared, from the convulsive movement of his
      lips, to be muttering a prayer. Out of patience, at length Gardiner gave
      the signal to Mauger, and the latter motioned the rebel captain to lay his
      head upon the piece of timber. The practised executioner performed his
      task with so much celerity that a minute had not elapsed before the head
      was stricken from the body, and placed on the point of a spear. While the
      apparatus of death and the blood-streaming trunk were removed, Xit, who
      was one of the spectators, seized the spear with its grisly burden, and,
      bending beneath the load, bore it towards the By-ward Tower. A man-at-arms
      preceded him, shouting in a loud voice, "Thus perish all traitors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen this punishment inflicted, Renard hastened towards the By-ward
      Tower, and avoiding the concourse that flocked round Xit and his
      sanguinary trophy, took a shorter cut, and arrived there before them. He
      found Pembroke and Bedingfeld, as the messenger had stated, prepared with
      a large force to make a sally upon the insurgents. The signal was given by
      renewed firing from the roof and loopholes of the Middle Tower. Wyat, who
      had retired under the gateway of that fortification, and had drawn up his
      men in the open space behind it, now advanced at their head to the attack.
      At this moment, the portcullis of the By-ward Tower was again raised, and
      the royalists issued from it. Foremost among them were the giants. The
      meeting of the two hosts took place in the centre of the bridge, and the
      shock was tremendous. For a short time, the result appeared doubtful. But
      the superior numbers, better arms, and discipline, of the queen's party,
      soon made it evident on which side victory would incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      If conquest could have been obtained by personal bravery, Wyat would have
      been triumphant. Wherever the battle raged most fiercely he was to be
      found. He sought out Bedingfeld, and failing in reaching him, cut his way
      to the Earl of Pembroke, whom he engaged and would have slain, if Og had
      not driven him off with his exterminating mace. The tremendous prowess of
      the gigantic brethren, indeed, contributed in no slight degree to the
      speedy termination of the fight. Their blows were resistless, and struck
      such terror into their opponents, that a retreat was soon begun, which
      Wyat found it impossible to check. Gnashing his teeth with anger, and
      uttering ejaculations of rage, he was compelled to follow his flying
      forces. His anger was vented against Gog. He aimed a terrible blow at him,
      and cut through his partizan, but his sword shivered against his morion. A
      momentary rally was attempted in the court between the Lion's Gate and the
      Bulwark Gate; but the insurgents were speedily, driven out. On reaching
      Tower Hill, Wyat succeeded in checking them; and though he could not
      compel them to maintain their ground; he endeavoured, with a faithful
      band, to cover the retreat of the main body to London Bridge. Perceiving
      his aim, Pembroke sent off a detachment under Bedingfeld, by Tower-street,
      to intercept the front ranks while he attacked the rear. But Wyat beat off
      his assailants, made a rapid retreat down Thames-street, and after a
      skirmish with Bedingfeld at the entrance of the bridge, in which he gained
      a decided advantage, contrived to get his troops safely across it, with
      much less loss than might have been anticipated. Nor was this all. He
      destroyed the planks which had afforded him passage, and took his measures
      so well and so expeditiously on the Southwark side, that Pembroke
      hesitated to cross the bridge and attack him. >
    </p>
    <p>
      The Tower, however, was delivered from its assailants. The three giants
      pursued the flying foe to the Bulwark Gate, and then returned to the
      Middle Tower, which was yet occupied by a number of Wyat's party, and
      summoned them to surrender! The command was refused, unless accompanied by
      a pardon. The giants said nothing more, but glanced significantly at each
      other. Magog seized a ram, which had been left by the assailants, and
      dashed it against the door on the left of the gateway. A few tremendous
      blows sufficed to burst it open. Finding no one within the lower chamber,
      they ascended the winding stone staircase, their progress up which was
      opposed, but ineffectually, by the insurgents. Magog pushed forward like a
      huge bull, driving his foes from step to step till they reached the roof,
      where a short but furious encounter took place. The gigantic brethren
      fought back to back, and committed such devastation among their foes, that
      those who were left alive threw down their arms, and begged for quarter.
      Disregarding their entreaties, the giants hurled them over the
      battlements. Some were drowned in the moat, while others wore dashed to
      pieces in the court below. "It is thus," observed Magog with a grim smile
      to his brethren, as the work of destruction was ended, "that the sons of
      the Tower avenge the insults offered to their parent."
    </p>
    <p>
      On descending, they found Xit stationed in the centre of the bridge,
      carrying the spear with Bret's head upon it. The dwarf eagerly inquired
      whether they had taken Wyat; and being answered in the negative, expressed
      his satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The achievement is reserved for me," he cried; "no more laughter, my
      masters,&mdash;no more familiarity. I am about to receive knighthood from
      the queen." This announcement, however, so far from checking the merriment
      of the giants, increased it to such a degree, that the irascible mannikin
      dashed the gory head in their faces, and would have attacked them with the
      spear, if they had not disarmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Sir Henry Bedingfeld had returned from the pursuit of the
      rebels. Many prisoners had been taken, and conveyed, by his directions, to
      a secure part of the fortress. Exerting-himself to the utmost, and
      employing a large body of men in the work, the damages done to the
      different defences of the fortress were speedily repaired, the bodies of
      the slain thrown into the river, and all rendered as secure as before. The
      crews on board Winter's squadron had surrendered; but their commander,
      together with the Duke of Suffolk, had escaped, having been put ashore in
      a small boat. Conceiving all lost, and completely panic-stricken, the Duke
      obtained horses for himself and a few companions, and riding to Shene,
      where he had appointed a meeting with his brother, Lord Thomas Grey, set
      off with him, at full speed, for Coventry, the inhabitants of which city
      he imagined were devoted to him. But he soon found out his error.
      Abandoned by his adherents, and betrayed into the hands of the Earl of
      Huntingdon, who had been sent after him, he was shortly afterwards brought
      a prisoner to the Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to anticipate events, such was the expedition used, that in less than
      an hour, Bedingfeld conveyed to the queen the intelligence that all damage
      done by the besiegers was repaired, and that her loss had been trifling
      compared with that of her enemies. He found her surrounded by her nobles;
      and on his appearance she arose, and advanced a few steps to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have discharged your office right well, Sir Henry," she said; "and if
      we deprive you of it for a while, it is because we mean to intrust you
      with a post of yet greater importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever office your majesty may intrust me with, I will gladly accept
      it," replied Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is our pleasure, then, that you set out instantly with the Earl of
      Sussex to Ashbridge," returned Mary, "and attach the person of the
      Princess Elizabeth. Here is your warrant. Bring her alive or dead." #
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" exclaimed Bedingfeld, "is this the task your highness has reserved
      for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," replied Mary; and she added in a lower tone, "you are the only
      man to whom I could confide it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must perforce obey, since your majesty wills it&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must set out at once," interrupted Mary&mdash;"Sir Thomas Brydges
      shall be lieutenant of the Tower in your stead. We reserve you for greater
      dignities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bedingfeld would have remonstrated, but seeing the queen was immoveable,
      he signified his compliance, and having received further instructions,
      quitted the presence to make preparations for his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last efforts of the insurgents must be briefly told. After allowing
      his men a few hours' rest, Wyat made a forced march to Kingston, and
      hastily repairing the bridge, which had been broken down, with planks,
      ladders, and beams tied together, passed over it with his ordnance and
      troops in safety, and proceeded towards London. In consequence of a delay
      that occurred on the road, his plan was discovered, and the Earl of
      Pembroke, having by this time collected a considerable army, drew up his
      forces in Saint James's fields to give him battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      A desperate skirmish took place, in which the insurgents, disheartened by
      their previous defeat, were speedily worsted. Another detachment, under
      the command of Knevet, were met and dispersed at Charing Cross, by Sir
      Henry Jerningham, and would have been utterly destroyed, but that they
      could not be distinguished from the royalists, except by their muddy
      apparel, which occasioned the cry among the victors of "Down with the
      draggle-tails."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wyat himself, who was bent upon entering the city, where he expected to
      meet with great aid from Throckmorton, dashed through all opposition, and
      rode as far as the Belle Sauvage (even then a noted hostel), near Ludgate.
      Finding the gate shut, and strongly defended, he rode back as quickly as
      he came to Temple Bar, where he was encountered by Sir Maurice Berkeley,
      who summoned him to surrender, and seeing it was useless to struggle
      further, for all his companions had deserted him, he complied. His captor
      carried him to the Earl of Pembroke; and as soon as it was known that the
      rebel-leader was taken, the army was disbanded, and every man ordered to
      return to his home. Proclamation was next made that no one, on pain of
      death, should harbour any of Wyat's faction, but should instantly deliver
      them up to the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night Wyat, together with Knevet, Cobham, and ethers of his
      captains, were taken to the Tower by water. As Wyat, who was the last to
      disembark, ascended the steps of Traitor's Gate, Sir Henry Brydges, the
      new lieutenant, seized him by the collar, crying, "Oh! thou base and
      unhappy traitor! how could'st thou find in thy heart to work such
      detestable treason against the queen's majesty? Were it not that the law
      must pass upon thee, I would stab thee with my dagger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding his arms to his side, and looking at him, as the old chroniclers
      report, "grievously, with a grim look," Wyat answered, "It is no mastery
      now." Upon which, he was conveyed with the others to the Beauchamp Tower.

      XXXI.&mdash;HOW JANE SURRENDERED HERSELF A PRISONER; AND HOW SHE BESOUGHT
      QUEEN MARY TO SPARE HER HUSBAND.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>owards the close
      of the day following that on which the rebels were defeated, a boat, rowed
      by a single waterman, shot London Bridge, and swiftly approached the Tower
      wharf. It contained two persons, one of whom, apparently a female, was so
      closely muffled in a cloak that her features could not be discerned; while
      her companion, a youthful soldier, equipped in his full accoutrements,
      whose noble features were clouded with sorrow, made no attempt at
      concealment. As they drew near the stairs, evidently intending to
      disembark, the sentinels presented their arquebusses at them, and ordered
      them to keep off; but the young man immediately arose, and said that
      having been concerned in the late insurrection, they were come to submit
      themselves to the queen's mercy. This declaration excited some surprise
      among the soldiers, who were inclined to discredit it, and would not have
      suffered them to land, if an officer of the guard, attracted by what was
      passing, had not interfered, and granted the request. By his command, they
      were taken across the draw-bridge opposite the stairs, and placed within
      the guard-room near the By-ward Tower. Here the officer who had
      accompanied them demanded their names and condition, in order to report
      them to the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am called Cuthbert Cholmondeley," replied the young man, "somewhile
      esquire to Lord Guilford Dudley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bore that rebel lord's standard in the attack on the Brass Mount&mdash;did
      you not?" demanded the officer, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did," replied Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have delivered yourself to certain death, young man," rejoined
      the officer. "What madness has brought you hither? The queen will show you
      no mercy, and blood enough will-flow upon the scaffold without yours being
      added to the stream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desire only to die with my master," replied Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is Lord Guilford Dudley?" demanded the muffled' female, in a tone
      of the deepest emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confined in one of the secret dungeons&mdash;but I may not answer you
      further, madam," replied the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are his wounds dangerous?" she continued, in a tone of the deepest
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are not mortal, madam," he answered. "He will live long enough to
      expiate his offences on the scaffold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" she exclaimed with difficulty, repressing a scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this&mdash;if you are a man," cried Cholmondeley, fiercely.
      "You know not whom you address." *
    </p>
    <p>
      "I partly guess." replied the officer, with a compassionate look. "I
      respect your sorrows, noble lady&mdash;but oh! why&mdash;why are you here?
      I would willingly serve you&mdash;nay, save you&mdash;but it is out of my
      power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My presence here must show you, sir, that I have no wish to avoid the
      punishment I have incurred," she replied. "I am come to submit myself to
      the queen. But if you would serve me&mdash;serve me without danger to
      yourself, or departure from your duty&mdash;you will convey this letter
      without delay to her highness's own hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be matter of difficulty," rejoined the officer, "for her majesty
      is at this moment engaged in a secret conference in the Hall Tower, with
      the chancellor and the Spanish ambassador. Nay, though I would not further
      wound your feelings, madam, she is about to sign the death-warrants of the
      rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more reason, then," she replied, in accents of supplicating
      eagerness, "that it should be delivered instantly. Will you take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven's blessing upon you!" she fervently ejaculated. Committing the
      captives to the guard, and desiring that every attention, consistent with
      their situation, should be shown them, the officer departed. Half an hour
      elapsed before his return, and during the interval but few words were
      exchanged between Cholmondeley and his companion. When the officer
      reappeared, she rushed towards him, and inquired what answer he brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your request is granted, madam," he replied. "I am commanded to bring you
      to the queen's presence; and may your suit to her highness prove as
      successful as your letter! You are to be delivered to the chief jailor,
      sir," he added to Chol-mondeley, "and placed in close custody."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Nightgall entered the guard-room. At the sight of his hated
      rival, an angry flush rose to the esquire's countenance&mdash;nor was his
      wrath diminished by the other's exulting looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not have much further power over me," he observed, in answer to
      the jailor's taunts. "Cicely, like Alexia, is out of the reach of your
      malice. And I shall speedily join them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken," retorted Nightgall, bitterly. "Cicely yet lives; and I
      will wed her on the day of your execution. Bring him away," he added, to
      his assistants. "I shall take him, in the first place, to the
      torture-chamber, and thence to the subterranean dungeons. I have an order
      to rack him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, madam," said the esquire, turning from him, and prostrating
      himself before his companion, who appeared in the deepest anguish; "we
      shall meet no more on earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have destroyed you," she cried. "But for your devotion to me, you might
      be now in safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think not of me, madam&mdash;I have nothing to live for," replied the
      esquire, pressing her hand to his lips. "Heaven support you in this your
      last, and greatest, and&mdash;as I can bear witness&mdash;most unmerited
      trial. Farewell, for ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, for ever!" repeated the lady. And she followed the officer; while
      Cholmondeley was conveyed by Nightgall and his assistants to the secret
      entrance of the subterranean dungeons near the Devilin Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accompanied by his charge, who was guarded by two halberdiers, the officer
      proceeded along the southern ward, in the direction of the Hall Tower&mdash;a
      vast circular structure, standing on the east of Bloody Tower.

    <p>
      This fabric, (sometimes called the Wakefield Tower from the prisoners
      confined within it, after the battle of that name in 1460, and more
      recently the Record Tower, from the use to which it has been put,) is one
      of the oldest in the fortress, and though not coeval with the White Tower,
      dates back as far as the reign of William Rufus, by whom it was erected.
      It contains two large octagonal chambers,&mdash;that on the upper story
      being extremely lofty, with eight deep and high embrazures, surmounted by
      pointed arches, and separated by thin columns, springing from the groined
      arches formerly supporting the ceiling, which though unfortunately
      destroyed, corresponded, no doubt, with the massive and majestic character
      of the apartment. In this room tradition asserts that
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &mdash;the aspiring blood of Lancaster
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sank in the ground:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;it being the supposed scene of the murder of Henry the Sixth by the
      ruthless Gloster. And whatever doubts may be entertained as to the truth
      of that dark legend, it cannot be denied that the chamber itself seems
      stamped with the gloomy character of the occurrence. In recent times, it
      has been devoted to a more peaceful purpose, and is now fitted up with
      presses containing the most ancient records of the kingdom. The room on
      the basement floor is of smaller dimensions, and much less lofty. The
      recesses, however, are equally deep, though not so high, and are headed by
      semicircular arches. At high tides it is flooded, and a contrivance for
      the escape of the water has been made in the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through an arched doorway on the east of this structure, where the
      entrance to the Record Office now stands, the officer conducted his
      prisoner up a spiral stone staircase, and left her in a small antechamber,
      while he announced her arrival. The unhappy lady still kept herself
      closely muffled. But though her features and figure were hidden, it was
      evident she trembled violently. In another moment, the officer reappeared,
      and motioning her to follow him, led the way along a narrow passage, at
      the end of which hangings were drawn aside by two ushers, and she found
      herself in the presence of the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary was seated at a table, near which stood Gardiner and Renard, and at
      the new-comer's appearance she instantly arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interview about to be related took place in the large octangular
      chamber previously described. It was sumptuously furnished: the walls were
      hung with arras from the looms of Flanders, and the deep recesses occupied
      with couches, or sideboards loaded with costly cups and vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily advancing towards the queen, the lady prostrated herself at her
      feet, and, throwing aside her disguise, revealed the features of Jane. She
      extended her hands supplicatingly towards Mary, and fixed her streaming
      eyes upon her, but was for some moments unable to speak.

      "I am come to submit myself to your highness's mercy," she said, as soon
      as she could find utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy!" exclaimed Mary, scornfully. "You shall receive justice, but no
      mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I neither deserve, nor desire it," replied Jane. "I have deeply, but not
      wilfully&mdash;Heaven is my witness!&mdash;offended your majesty, and I
      will willingly pay the penalty of my fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you with me?" demanded Mary. "I have acceded to this interview
      in consideration of your voluntary submission. But be brief. I have
      important business before me, and my heart is steeled to tears and
      supplications."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say not so, gracious madam," rejoined Jane. "A woman's heart can never be
      closed to the pleadings of the unfortunate of her own sex, still less the
      heart of one so compassionate as your highness. I do not sue for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For whom, then?" demanded the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my husband," replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am about to sign his death-warrant,1' replied Mary, in a freezing tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not attempt to exculpate him, madam," returned Jane, restraining
      her emotion by a powerful effort, "for his offence cannot be extenuated.
      Nay, I deplore his rashness as much as your highness can condemn it. But I
      am well assured that vindictiveness is no part of your royal nature&mdash;that
      you disdain to crush a fallen foe&mdash;and that, when the purposes of
      justice are answered, no sentiments but those of clemency will sway your
      bosom. I myself, contrary to my own wishes, have been the pretext for the
      late insurrection, and it is right I should suffer, because while my life
      remains, your highness may not feel secure. But my husband has no claims,
      pretended or otherwise, to the throne, and when I am removed, all fear of
      him will be at an end. Let what I have done speak my sincerity. I <i>could</i>
      have escaped to France, if I had chosen. But I did not choose to accept
      safety on such terms. Well knowing with whom I had to deal&mdash;knowing
      also that my life is of more importance than my husband's, I have come to
      offer myself for him. If your highness has any pity for me, extend it to
      him, and heap his faults on my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jane," said Mary, much moved&mdash;"you love your husband devotedly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need not say I love him better than my life, madam," replied Jane, "for
      my present conduct will prove that I do so. But I love him so well, that
      even his treason to your highness, to whom he already owes his life,
      cannot shake it. Oh, madam! as you hope to be happy in your union with the
      Prince of Spain&mdash;as you trust to be blessed with a progeny which
      shall continue on the throne of this kingdom&mdash;spare my husband&mdash;spare
      him for my sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For <i>your</i> sake, Jane, I would spare him," replied Mary, in a tone
      of great emotion, "but I cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cannot, madam!" cried Jane&mdash;"you are an absolute queen, and who
      shall say you nay? Not your council&mdash;not your nobles&mdash;not your
      people&mdash;not your own heart. Your majesty <i>can</i> and <i>will</i>
      pardon him. Nay, I read your gracious purpose in your looks. You will
      pardon him, and your clemency shall do more to strengthen your authority
      than the utmost severity could do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Saint Paul!" whispered Renard to Gardiner, who had listened with great
      interest to the conference, and now saw with apprehension the effect
      produced on Mary, "she will gain her point, if we do not interfere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave it to me," replied Gardiner. "Your majesty will do well to accede
      to the Lady Jane's request," he remarked aloud to the queen, "provided she
      will comply with your former proposition, and embrace the faith of Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay," replied Mary, her features suddenly lighting up, "on these terms I
      will spare him. But your reconciliation with our holy church," she added
      to Jane, "must be public."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness will not impose these fatal conditions upon me," cried
      Jane, distractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no other will I accede," replied Mary, peremptorily. "Nay, I have gone
      too far already. But my strong sympathy for you as a wife, and my zeal for
      my religion, are my inducements. Embrace our faith, and I pardon your
      husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot," replied Jane, in accents of despair; "I will die for him, but
      I cannot destroy my soul alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you shall perish together," replied Mary, fiercely. "What ho!
      guards. Let the Lady Grey be conveyed to the Brick Tower, and kept a close
      prisoner during our pleasure." And, waving her hand, Jane was removed by
      the attendants, while Mary seated herself at the table, and took up some
      of the papers with which it was strewn, to conceal her agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You struck the right key, my lord,&mdash;bigotry," observed Renard, in an
      under tone to Gardiner.

    <h2>
      XXXII.&mdash;HOW THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH WAS BROUGHT A PRISONER TO THE
      TOWER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>harged with the
      painful and highly-responsible commission imposed upon him by the queen,
      Sir Henry Bedingfeld, accompanied by the Earl of Sussex and three others
      of the council, Sir Richard Southwell, Sir Edward Hastings, and Sir Thomas
      Cornwallis, with a large retinue, and a troop of two hundred and fifty
      horse, set out for Ashbridge, where Elizabeth had shut herself up
      previously to the outbreak of Wyat's insurrection. On their arrival, they
      found her confined to her room with real or feigned indisposition, and she
      refused to appear; but as their mission did not admit of delay, they were
      compelled to force their way to her chamber. The haughty princess, whose
      indignation was roused to the highest pitch by the freedom, received them
      in such manner as to leave no doubt how she would sway the reins of
      government, if they should ever come within her grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am guiltless of all design against my sister," she said, "and I shall
      easily convince her of my innocence. And then look well, sirs&mdash;you
      that have abused her authority&mdash;that I requite not your scandalous
      treatment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would have willingly declined the office," replied Bedingfeld; "but the
      queen was peremptory. It will rejoice me to find you can clear yourself
      with her highness, and I am right well assured, when you think calmly of
      the matter, you will acquit me and my companions of blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he formed no erroneous estimate of Elizabeth's character. With all her
      proneness to anger, she had the strongest sense of justice. Soon after her
      accession, she visited the old knight at his seat, Oxburgh Hall, in
      Norfolk;&mdash;still in the possession of his lineal descendant, the
      present Sir Henry Bedingfeld, and one of the noblest mansions in the
      county,&mdash;and, notwithstanding his adherence to the ancient faith,
      manifested the utmost regard for him, playfully terming him "her jailor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning, Elizabeth was placed in a litter, with her female
      attendants; and whether from the violence of her passion, or that she had
      not exaggerated her condition, she swooned, and on her recovery appeared
      so weak that they were obliged to proceed slowly. During the whole of the
      journey, which occupied five days, though it might have been easily
      accomplished in one, she was strictly guarded;&mdash;the greatest
      apprehension being entertained of an attempt at rescue by some of her
      party. On the last day, she robed herself in white, in token of her
      innocence; and on her way to Whitehall, where the queen was staying, she
      drew aside the curtains of her litter, and displayed a countenance,
      described in Renard's despatches to the Emperor, as "proud, lofty, and
      superbly disdainful,&mdash;an expression assumed to disguise her
      mortification." On her arrival at the palace, she earnestly entreated an
      audience of her majesty, but the request was refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Elizabeth underwent a rigorous examination by Gardiner and
      nineteen of the council, touching her privity to the conspiracy of De
      Noailles, and her suspected correspondence with Wyat. She admitted having
      received letters from the French ambassador on behalf of Courtenay, for
      whom, notwithstanding his unworthy conduct, she still owned she
      entertained the warmest affection, but denied any participation in his
      treasonable practices, and expressed the utmost abhorrence of Wyat's
      proceedings. Her assertions, though stoutly delivered, did not convince
      her interrogators, and Gardiner told her that Wyat had confessed on the
      rack that he had written to her, and received an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! says the traitor so?" cried Elizabeth. "Confront me with him, and if
      he will affirm as much to my face, I will own myself guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Earl of Devonshire has likewise confessed, and has offered to resign
      all pretensions to your hand, and to go into exile, provided the queen
      will spare his life," rejoined Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Courtenay faithless!" exclaimed the princess, all her haughtiness
      vanishing, and her head, declining upon her bosom, "then it is time I went
      to the Tower. You may spare yourselves the trouble of questioning me
      further, my lords, for by my faith I will not answer you another word&mdash;-no,
      not even if you employ the rack."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the council departed. Strict watch was kept over her during the
      night. Above a hundred of the guard were stationed within the
      palace-gardens, and a great fire was lighted in the hall, before which Sir
      Henry Bedingfeld and the Earl of Sussex, with a large band of armed men,
      remained till day-breaks At nine o'clock, word was brought to the princess
      that the tide suited for her conveyance to the Tower. It was raining
      heavily, and Elizabeth refused to stir forth on the score of her
      indisposition. But Bedingfeld told her the queen's commands were
      peremptory, and besought her not to compel him to use force. Seeing
      resistance was in vain, she consented with an ill grace, and as she passed
      through the garden to the water-side, she cast her eyes towards the
      windows of the palace, in the hope of seeing Mary, but was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain continued during the whole of her passage, and the appearance of
      every thing on the river was as dismal and depressing as her own thoughts.
      But Elizabeth was not of a nature to be easily subdued. Rousing all her
      latent energy, she bore up firmly against her distress. An accident had
      well nigh occurred as they shot London Bridge. She had delayed her
      departure so long that the fall was considerable, and the prow of the boat
      struck upon the ground with such force as almost to upset it, and it was
      some time before it righted. Elizabeth was wholly unmoved by their
      perilous situation, and only remarked that "She would that the torrent had
      sunk them." Terrible as the stern old fortress appeared to those who
      approached it under similar circumstances, to Elizabeth it assumed its
      most appalling aspect. Gloomy at all times, it looked gloomier than usual
      now, with the rain driving against it in heavy scuds, and the wind,
      whistling round its ramparts and fortifications, making the flag-staff and
      the vanes on the White Tower creak, and chilling the sentinels exposed to
      its fury to the bone. The storm agitated the river, and the waves more
      than once washed over the sides of the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not making for Traitors Gate," cried Elizabeth, seeing that the
      skiff was steered in that direction; "it is not fit that the daughter of
      Henry the Eighth should land at those steps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such are the queen's commands," replied Bedingfeld, sorrowfully. "I dare
      not for my head disobey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will leap overboard sooner," rejoined Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray your highness to have patience," returned Bedingfeld, restraining
      her. "It would be unworthy of you&mdash;of your great father, to take so
      desperate a step."
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth compressed her lips and looked sternly at the old knight, who
      made a sign to the rowers to use their utmost despatch; and, in another
      moment, they shot beneath the gloomy gateway. The awful effect of passing
      under this dreadful arch has already been described, and Elizabeth, though
      she concealed her emotion, experienced its full horrors. The Water-gate
      revolved on its massive hinges, and the boat struck against the foot of
      the steps. Sussex and Bedingfeld, and the rest of the guard and her
      attendants, then landed, while Sir Thomas Brydges, the new lieutenant,
      with several warders, advanced to the top of the steps to receive her. But
      she would not move, but continued obstinately in the boat, saying, "I am
      no traitor, and do not choose to land here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall <i>not</i> choose, madam,'" replied Bedingfeld,
      authoritatively. "The queen's orders must, and <i>shall</i> be obeyed.
      Disembark, I pray you, without more ado, or it will go hardly with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This from von, Bedingfeld," rejoined Elizabeth, reproachfully, "and at
      such a time, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no alternative,'" replied the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, I will not put you to further shame," replied the princess,
      rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it please you to take my cloak as a protection against the rain?"
      said Bedingfeld, offering it to her. But she pushed it aside "with a good
      dash," as old Fox relates; and springing on the steps, cried in a loud
      voice, "Here lands as true a subject, being prisoner, as ever set foot on
      these stairs. And before thee, O God, I speak it, having no other friend
      but thee." *
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness is unjust," replied Bedingfeld, who stood bare-headed
      beside her; "you have many friends, and amongst them none more zealous
      than myself. And if I counsel you to place some restraint upon your
      conduct, it is because I am afraid it may be disadvantageous reported to
      the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say what you please of me, sir," replied Elizabeth; "I will not be told
      how I am to act by you, or any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least move forward, madam," implored Bedingfeld; "you will be drenched
      to the skin if you tarry here longer, and will fearfully increase your
      fever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What matters it if I do?" replied Elizabeth, seating herself on the damp
      step, while the shower descended in torrents upon her. "I will move
      forward at my own pleasure&mdash;not at your bidding. And let us see
      whether you will dare to use force towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, madam, if you forget yourself, I will not forget what is due to your
      father's daughter," replied Bedingfeld, "you shall have ample time for
      reflection."
    </p>
    <p>
      The deeply-commiserating and almost paternal tone in which this reproof
      was delivered touched the princess sensibly; and glancing round, she was
      further moved by the mournful looks of her attendants, many of whom were
      deeply affected, and wept audibly. As soon as her better feelings
      conquered, she immediately yielded to them; and, presenting her hand to
      the old knight, said, "You are right, and I am wrong, Bedingfeld. Take me
      to my dungeon."

    <h2>
      XXXIII.&mdash;HOW NIGHTGALL WAS BRIBED BY DE NOAILLES TO ASSASSINATE SIMON
      RENARD; AND HOW JANE'S DEATH-WARRANT WAS SIGNED.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Tower was now
      thronged with illustrious prisoners. All the principal personages
      concerned in the late rebellion, with the exception of Sir Peter Carew,
      who had escaped to France, were confined within its walls; and the queen
      and her council wore unremittingly employed in their examinations. The
      Duke of Suffolk had written and subscribed his confession, throwing
      himself upon the royal mercy; Lord Guilford Dudley, who was slowly
      recovering from his wound, refused to answer any interrogatories; while
      Sir Thomas Wyat, whose constancy was shaken by the severity of the torture
      to which he was exposed, admitted his treasonable correspondence with
      Elizabeth and Courtenay, and charged De Noailles with being the originator
      of the plot. The latter was likewise a prisoner. But as it was not the
      policy of England, at that period, to engage in a war with France, he was
      merely placed under personal restraint until an answer could be received
      from Henry the Second, to whom letters had been sent by Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well instructed as to the purport of these despatches, and confident of
      his sovereigns protection, De Noailles felt little uneasiness as to his
      situation, and did not even despair of righting himself by some
      master-stroke. His grand object was to remove Renard; and as he could not
      now accomplish this by fair means, he determined to have recourse to foul;
      and to procure his assassination. Confined, with certain of his suite,
      within the Flint Tower, he was allowed, at stated times, to take exercise
      on the Green, and in other parts of the fortress, care being taken to
      prevent him from holding communication with the other prisoners, or,
      indeed, with any one except his attendants. De Noailles, however, had a
      ready and unsuspected instrument at hand. This was his jailor, Lawrence
      Nightgall, with whom he had frequent opportunities of conversing, and whom
      he had already sounded on the subject. Thus, while every dungeon in the
      fortress was filled with the victims of his disastrous intrigues; while
      its subterranean chambers echoed with the groans of the tortured; while
      some expired upon the rack, others were secretly executed, and the public
      scaffold was prepared for sufferers of the highest rank; while the axe and
      the block were destined to frequent and fearful employment, and the
      ensanguined ground thirsted for the best and purest blood in England;
      while such was the number of captives that all the prisons in London were
      insufficient to contain them, and they were bestowed within the churches;
      while twenty pairs of gallows were erected in the public places of the
      city, and the offenders with whom they were loaded left to rot upon them
      as a terrible example to the disaffected; while universal dread and
      lamentation prevailed,&mdash;the known author of all this calamity
      remained, from prudential reasons, unpunished, and pursued his dark and
      dangerous machinations as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, when he was alone, Nightgall entered his chamber, and, closing
      the door, observed, with a mysterious look,&mdash;"Your excellency has
      thrown out certain dark hints to me of late. You can speak safely now, and
      I pray you do so plainly. What do you desire me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Do Noailles looked scrutinizingly at him, as if he feared some treachery.
      But at length, appearing satisfied, he said abruptly, "I desire Renards
      assassination. His destruction is of the utmost importance to my king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a great crime," observed Nightgall, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The reward will be proportionate," rejoined De Noailles.. "What does your
      excellency offer?" asked Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand angels of gold," replied the ambassador, "and a post at the
      court of France, if you will fly thither when the deed is done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my troth, a tempting offer," rejoined Nightgall. "But I am under great
      obligations to M. Simon Renard. He appointed me to my present place. It
      would appear ungrateful to kill him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pshaw!" exclaimed De Noailles, contemptuously. "You are not the man to
      let such idle scruples stand in the way of your fortune. Renard only
      promoted you because you were useful to him. And he would sacrifice you as
      readily, if it suited his purpose. He will serve you better dead than
      living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a bargain," replied Nightgall. "I have the keys of the subterranean
      passages, and can easily get out of the Tower when I have despatched him.
      Your excellency can fly with me if you think proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no account," rejoined De Noailles. "I must not appear in the matter.
      Come to me when the deed is done, and I will furnish you with means for
      your flight, and with a letter to the king of France, which shall ensure
      you your reward when you reach Paris. But it must be done quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be done to-morrow night," replied Nightgall. "Fortunately, M.
      Renard has chosen for his lodgings the chamber in the Bloody Tower in
      which the two princes were murdered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fitting spot for his own slaughter," remarked De Noailles, drily. "It
      is so, in more ways than one," replied Nightgall; "for I can approach him
      unawares by a secret passage, through which, when all is over, escape will
      be easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" exclaimed De Noailles, rubbing his hands gleefully. "I should like
      to be with you at the time. Mortdieu! how I hate that man. He has thwarted
      all my schemes. But I shall now have my revenge. Take this ring and this
      purse in earnest of what is to follow, and mind you strike home."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing," replied Nightgall, smiling grimly, and playing his dagger;
      "the blow shall not need to be repeated. Your excellency's plan chimes
      well with a project of my own. There is a maiden whom I have long sought,
      but vainly, to make my bride. I will carry her off with me to France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will impede your flight," observed De Noailles, hastily. "On all
      difficult occasions, women are sadly in the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot leave her," rejoined Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take her, then, in the devil's name," rejoined De Noailles, peevishly;
      "and if she brings you to the gallows, do not forget my warning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My next visit shall be to tell you your enemy is no more," returned
      Nightgall. "Before midnight to-morrow, you may expect me." And he quitted
      the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      While his destruction was planned in the manner above-related, Simon
      Renard was employing all his art to crush by one fell stroke all the heads
      of the Protestant party. But he met with opposition from quarters where he
      did not anticipate it. Though the queen was convinced of Elizabeth's
      participation in the plot, as well from Wyat's confession, who owned that
      he had written to her during his march to London, offering to proclaim her
      queen, and had received favourable answers from her,&mdash;as from the
      declaration of a son of Lord Russell, to the effect, that he had delivered
      the despatches into her own hand, and brought back her replies;&mdash;notwithstanding
      this, Mary refused to pass sentence upon her, and affected to believe her
      innocent. Neither would she deal harshly with Courtenay, though equally
      satisfied of his guilt; and Renard, unable to penetrate her motives, began
      to apprehend that she still nourished a secret attachment to him. The
      truth was, the princess and her lover had a secret friend in Gardiner, who
      counteracted the sanguinary designs of the ambassador. Baffled in this
      manner, Renard determined to lose no time with the others. Already, by his
      agency, the Duke of Suffolk, Lord Thomas Grey, and Wyat, were condemned&mdash;Dudley
      and Jane alone were wanting to the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touched, by a strong feeling of compassion for their youth, and yet more
      by the devotion Jane had exhibited to her husband, Mary hesitated to sign
      their death-warrant. She listened to all Renard's arguments with
      attention, but they failed to move her. She could not bring herself to put
      a period to the existence of one whom she knew to be so pure, so lovely,
      so loving, so blameless, as Jane. But Renard was determined to carry his
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will destroy them all," he said; "but I will begin with Dudley and
      Jane, and end with Courtenay and Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the examination of the conspirators, the queen, though she had
      moved her court to Whitehall, passed much of her time at the Tower,
      occupied in reading the depositions of the prisoners, or in framing
      interrogatories to put to them. She also wrote frequent despatches to the
      emperor, whose counsel she asked in her present difficulties; and while
      thus occupied, she was often closeted for hours with Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether by accident, or that the gloomy legend connected with it,
      harmonising with his own sombre thoughts, gave it an interest in his eyes,
      Renard had selected for his present lodging in the Tower, as intimated by
      Nightgall, the chamber in which the two youthful princes were destroyed.
      It might be that its contiguity to the Hall Tower, where Mary now for the
      most part held her conferences with her council, and with which it was
      connected by a secret passage, occasioned this selection&mdash;or he might
      have been influenced by other motives&mdash;suffice it to say he there
      took up his abode; and was frequently visited within it by Mary. Occupying
      the upper story of the Bloody Tower, this mysterious chamber looks on the
      north upon the ascent leading to the Green, and on the south upon Saint
      Thomas's Tower. It is now divided into two rooms by a screen&mdash;that to
      the south being occupied as a bed-chamber; and tradition asserts, that in
      this part of the room the "piece of ruthless butchery," which stamps it
      with such fearful interest, was perpetrated. On the same side, between the
      outer wall and the chamber, runs a narrow passage, communicating on the
      west with the ballium wall, and thence with the lieutenant's lodgings, by
      which the murderers are said to have approached; and in the inner
      partition is a window, through which they gazed upon their sleeping
      victims. On the east, the passage communicates with a circular staircase,
      descending to a small vaulted chamber at the right of the gateway, where
      the bodies were interred. In later times, this mysterious room has been
      used as a prison-lodging. It was occupied by Lord Ferrers during his
      confinement in the Tower, and more recently by the conspirators Watson and
      Thistlewood.

    </h5>
    <p>
      On the evening appointed by Nightgall for the assassination of Renard, the
      proposed victim and the queen were alone within this chamber. The former
      had renewed all his arguments, and with greater force than ever, and
      seeing he had produced the desired impression, he placed before her the
      warrant for the execution of Jane and her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will never wear your crown easily till you sign that paper,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never wear it easily afterwards," sighed Mary. "Do you not
      remember Jane's words? She told me, I should be fortunate in my union, and
      my race should continue upon the throne, if I spared her husband. They
      seem to me prophetic. If I sign this warrant, I may destroy my own
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness will be not turned from your purpose by such idle fears,"
      rejoined Renard, in as sarcastic a tone as he dared assume. "Not only your
      throne may be endangered, if you suffer them to live, but the Catholic
      religion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied Mary, "I will no longer hesitate."
    </p>
    <p>
      And she attached her signature to the warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard watched her with a look of such fiendish exultation, that an unseen
      person who gazed at the moment into the room, seeing a tall dark figure,
      dilated by the gloom, for it was deepening twilight, and a countenance
      from which everything human was banished, thought he beheld a demon, and,
      fascinated by terror, could not withdraw his eyes. At the same moment,
      too, the queen's favourite dog, which was couched at her feet, and for a
      short time previously had been uttering a low growl, now broke into a
      fierce bark, and sprang towards the passage-window. Mary turned to
      ascertain the cause of the animal's disquietude, and perceived that it had
      stiffened in every joint, while its barking changed to a dismal howl. Not
      without misgiving, she glanced towards the window&mdash;and there, at the
      very place whence she had often heard that the murderers had gazed upon
      the slumbering innocents before the bloody deed was done&mdash;there,
      between those bars, she beheld a hideous black mask, through the holes of
      which glared a pair of flashing orbs.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Repressing a cry of alarm, she called Renard's attention to the object,
      when she was equally startled by his appearance. He seemed transfixed with
      horror, with his right hand extended towards the mysterious object, and
      clenched, while the left grasped his sword. Suddenly, he regained his
      consciousness, and drawing his rapier, dashed to the door,&mdash;but ere
      he could open it, the mask had disappeared. He hurried along the passage
      in the direction of the lieutenant's lodgings, when he encountered some
      one who appeared to be advancing towards him. Seizing this person by the
      throat and presenting his sword to his breast, he found from the voice
      that it was Nightgall.

    <h2>
      XXXIV.&mdash;HOW THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH WAS CONFRONTED WITH SIR THOMAS
      WYAT IN THE TORTURE-CHAMBER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s Elizabeth passed
      beneath the portal of the Bloody Tower, on her way to the lieutenant's
      lodgings, whither she was conducted after quitting Traitor's Gate, by
      Bedingfeld and Sussex, she encountered the giants, who doffed their caps
      at her approach, and fell upon their knees. All three were greatly
      affected, especially Magog, whose soft and sensitive nature was completely
      overcome. Big tears rolled down his cheeks, and in attempting to utter a
      few words of consolation, his voice failed him. Touched by his distress,
      Elizabeth halted for a moment, and laying her hand on his broad shoulder,
      said in a tone, and with a look calculated to enforce her words, "Bear up,
      good fellow, and like a man. If I shed no tears for myself, those who love
      me need shed none. It is the duty of my friends to comfort&mdash;not to
      dishearten me. My ease is not so hopeless as you think. The queen will
      never condemn the innocent, and unheard. Get up, I say, and put a bold
      face on the matter, or you are not your father's son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Roused by this address, Magog obeyed, and rearing his bulky frame to its
      full height, so that his head almost touched the spikes of the portcullis,
      cried in a voice of thunder, "Would your innocence might be proved by the
      combat, madam, as in our&mdash;" and he hesitated,&mdash;"I mean your
      royal father's time! I would undertake to maintain your truth against any
      odds. Nay, I and my brethren would bid defiance to the whole host of your
      accusers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though I may not claim you as champions," replied Elizabeth; "I will
      fight my own battle, as stoutly as you could fight it for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your grace's courage will prevail," rejoined Og.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My innocence will," returned Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," cried Gog. "Your grace, I am assured, would no more harbour
      disloyalty against the queen than we should; seeing that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," interrupted the princess, hastily. "Farewell, good friends," she
      continued, extending her hand to them, which they eagerly pressed to their
      lips, "farewell! be of good cheer. No man shall have cause to weep for
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a proud, though a sad day," observed Og, who was the last
      honoured by the princess's condescension, "and will never be obliterated
      from my memory. By my father's beard!" he added, gazing rapturously at the
      long, taper fingers he was permitted to touch, "it is the most beautiful
      hand I ever beheld, and whiter than the driven snow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleased by the compliment&mdash;for she was by no means insensible to
      admiration,&mdash;Elizabeth forgave its unseasonableness for its evident
      sincerity, and smilingly departed. But she had scarcely ascended the steps
      leading to the Green, when she was chilled by the sight of Renard, who was
      standing at the northern entrance of the Bloody Tower, wrapped in his
      cloak, and apparently waiting to see her pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drew near, he stepped forward, and made her a profound, but
      sarcastic salutation. His insolence, however, failed in its effect upon
      Elizabeth. Eyeing him with the utmost disdain, she observed to Bedingfeld,
      "Put that Spanish knave out of my path. And he who will remove him from
      the queen's councils will do both her and me a good turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace has sufficient room to pass," returned Renard, with bitter
      irony, and laying his hand upon the hilt of his sword, as if determined to
      resist any attempt to remove him. "Your prison within the Bell Tower is
      prepared, and if my counsels have any weight with her majesty, you will
      quit it only to take the same path, and ascend the same scaffold as your
      mother, Anne Boleyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another such taunt," cried Sussex, fiercely, "and neither the sacred
      character of your office, nor the protection of the queen, shall save you
      from my sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he thrust him forcibly backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth moved on at a slow and stately pace, while the guard closing
      round her and Sussex, opposed the points of their halberds to the
      infuriated ambassador.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness has increased Renard's enmity," observed Bedingfeld, with a
      troubled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear him not," replied Elizabeth, dauntlessly. "Let him do his worst.
      English honesty will ever prove more than a match for Spanish guile."
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the lieutenant's lodgings, and traversing the long gallery
      already described as running in a westerly direction, Elizabeth soon
      reached the upper chamber of the Bell Tower, which, she was informed by
      Sir Thomas Brydges, was appointed for her prison.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0448.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      "It is a sorry lodging for a king's daughter," she observed, "and for one
      who may be queen of this realm. But since my sister will have it so, I
      must make shift with it. How many attendants are allowed me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One female," replied Brydges.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not deprive me of all?" cried the princess, passionately. "This
      chamber will barely accommodate me. I will be alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As your grace pleases,'" replied Brydges, "but I cannot exceed my
      authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I write to the queen?" demanded Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be furnished with writing-materials, if it is your purpose to
      prepare your confession," returned the lieutenant. "But it must be
      delivered to the council, who will exercise their discretion as to
      transmitting it to her highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed the princess, "am I at <i>their</i> mercy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! madam, you are so," replied Bedingfeld; "but the chancellor is your
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure of it," returned Elizabeth. "Oh! that I could see the
      queen, were it but for one minute. My mother perished because she could
      not obtain a hearing of my royal sire, whose noble nature was abused in
      respect to her; and the Duke of Somerset himself told me, that if his
      brother the Admiral had been allowed speech of him, he would never have
      consented to his death. But it is ever thus. The throne is surrounded by a
      baneful circle, whose business is to prevent the approach of truth. They
      keep me from my sister's presence, well knowing that I could clear myself
      at once, while they fill her ears with false reports. Bedingfeld, you are
      her faithful servant, and, therefore, not my enemy. Tell her, if she will
      grant me an audience alone, or before her councillors, I will either
      approve my innocence, or consent to lose my head. Above all, implore her
      to let me be confronted with Wyat, that the truth may be extorted from
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The interview would little benefit your grace," remarked Brydges. "Wyat
      confesses your privity to the rebellion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He lies," replied Elizabeth, fiercely. "The words have been put into his
      mouth with the vain hope of pardon. But he will recant them if he sees me.
      He dare not&mdash;will not look me in the face, and aver that I am a
      partner in his foul practices. But I will not believe it of him. Despite
      his monstrous treason, he is too brave, too noble-minded, to act so
      recreant a part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wyat has undergone the question ordinary, and extraordinary, madam,"
      replied Brydges; "and though he endured the first with surprising
      constancy, his fortitude sank under the severity of the latter
      application."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I forgive him," rejoined Elizabeth, in a tone of deep commiseration. "But
      it proves nothing. He avowed thus much to escape further torture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be," returned Brydges, "and for your grace's sake I hope it is so.
      But his confession, signed with his own hand, has been laid before the
      queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed Elizabeth, sinking into the only seat which the dungeon
      contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beseech your highness to compose yourself," cried Bedingfeld,
      compassionately. "We will withdraw and leave you to the care of your
      attendant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want no assistance," replied Elizabeth, recovering herself. "Will you
      entreat her majesty to grant me an audience on the terms I have named, and
      in the presence of Wyat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be speedy, then," remarked Brydges, "for he is adjudged to die
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow!" echoed Elizabeth. "Nay, then, good Bedingfeld, seek the queen
      without delay. Implore her by the love she once bore me&mdash;by the love
      I am assured she bears me still&mdash;to interrogate me before this
      traitor. If he perishes with this confession uncontradicted, I am lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your words shall be repeated to her highness," replied Bedingfeld, "and I
      will not fail to add my entreaties to your own. But I cannot give a hope
      that your request will be granted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is fortunate for your highness that the queen visits the Tower
      to-day," observed Brydges. "Her arrival is momently expected. As I live!"
      he exclaimed, as the bell was rung overhead, and answered by the beating
      of drums and the discharge of cannon from the batteries, "she is here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Heaven's interposition in my behalf," cried Elizabeth, "Go to her
      at once, Bedingfeld. Let not the traitor, Renard, get the start of you. I
      may live to requite the service. Go&mdash;go." #
    </p>
    <p>
      The old knight obeyed, and the others immediately afterwards retired,
      closing the door upon the princess, and placing a guard outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Elizabeth flew to the narrow, and strongly-grated loophole,
      commanding the southern ward, through which the queen must necessarily
      pass on her way to the palace, in the hope of catching a glimpse of her.
      She had not to wait long. Loud fanfares of trumpets resounded from the
      gate of the By-ward Tower. These martial flourishes were succeeded by the
      trampling of steeds, and fresh discharges of ordnance, and the next
      moment, a numerous retinue of horse and foot emerged from the gateway.
      Just as the royal litter appeared, it was stopped by Sir Henry Bedingfeld,
      and the curtains were drawn aside by Mary's own hand. It was a moment of
      intense interest to Elizabeth, and she watched the countenance of the old
      knight, as if her life depended upon each word he uttered. At first, she
      could not see the queen's face, but as Bedingfeld concluded, Mary leaned
      forward, and looked up at the Bell Tower. Uncertain whether she could be
      seen, Elizabeth determined to make her presence known, and thrusting her
      hand through the bars, waved her kerchief. Mary instantly drew back. The
      curtains of the litter were closed; Bedingfeld stepped aside; and the
      cavalcade moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She will not see me!" cried Elizabeth, sinking back in despair. "I shall
      perish like my mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess's agitation did not subside for some time. Expecting
      Bedingfeld to return with the tidings that Mary had refused her request,
      she listened anxiously to every sound, in the hope that it might announce
      his arrival. Hour after hour passed by and he came not, and concluding
      that he did not like to be the bearer of ill news, or what was yet more
      probable, that he was not allowed to visit her, she made up her mind to
      the worst. Elizabeth had not the same resources as Jane under similar
      circumstances. Though sincerely religious, she had not the strong piety
      that belonged to the other, nor could she, like her, divorce herself from
      the world, and devote herself wholly to God. Possessing the greatest
      fortitude, she had no resignation, and while capable of enduring any
      amount of physical suffering, could not controul her impatience. Her
      thoughts were bitter and mortifying enough, but she felt no humiliation;
      and the only regrets she indulged were at having acted so unwise a part.
      Scalding tears bedewed her cheeks&mdash;tears that would never have been
      shed, if any one had been present; and her mingled emotions of rage and
      despair were so powerful, that she had much ado to overcome them.
      Ungovernable fury against Mary took possession of her, and she pondered
      upon a thousand acts of revenge. Then came the dreadful sense of her
      present situation&mdash;of its hopelessness&mdash;its despair. She looked
      at the stone walls by which she was inclosed, and invoked them to fall
      upon her and crush her&mdash;and she rushed towards the massive and
      iron-girded door, as if she would dash herself against it with impotent
      fury. Her breast was ravaged by fierce and conflicting passions; and when
      she again returned to her seat, she grasped it convulsively to prevent
      herself from executing the desperate deeds that suggested themselves to
      her. In after years, when the crown was placed upon her head, and she
      grasped one of the most powerful sceptres ever swayed by female hand&mdash;when
      illustrious captives were placed in that very dungeon by her command, and
      one royal victim, near almost to her as a sister, lingered out her days in
      hopeless captivity, only to end them on the block&mdash;at such seasons,
      she often recalled her own imprisonment&mdash;often in imagination endured
      its agonies, but never once with a softened or relenting heart. The sole
      thought that now touched her, and subdued her violence, was that of
      Courtenay. Neither his unworthiness nor his inconstancy could shake her
      attachment. She loved him deeply and devotedly&mdash;with all the strength
      and fervour of her character; and though she had much difficulty in saving
      him from her contempt, this feeling did not abate the force of her regard.
      The idea that he would perish with her, in some degree reconciled her to
      her probable fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus meditating, alternately roused by the wildest resentment, and
      softened by thoughts of love, Elizabeth passed the remainder of the day
      without interruption. Worn out, at length, she was about to dispose
      herself to slumber, when the door was opened, and Sir Thomas Brydges,
      accompanied by two serving-men and a female attendant, entered the room.
      Provisions were placed before her by the men, who instantly withdrew, and
      Brydges was about to follow, leaving the female attendant behind, when
      Elizabeth stopped him, and inquired what answer Sir Henry Bedingfeld had
      brought from the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My orders are to hold no communication with your grace," replied the
      lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, tell me when I am to be examined by the council?" rejoined
      Elizabeth. "The meanest criminal has a right to be so informed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Brydges shook his head, and quitting the chamber, closed the door, and
      barred it outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Controlling her feelings, as she was now no longer alone, Elizabeth
      commanded her attendant to awaken her in an hour, and threw herself upon
      the couch. Her injunctions were strictly complied with, and she arose
      greatly refreshed. A lamp had been left her, and taking up a book of
      prayers, she addressed herself to her devotions, and while thus occupied
      her mind gradually resumed its composure. About midnight, the door was
      opened by the lieutenant, who entered the room attended by Nightgall, and
      two other officials in sable robes, while a guard of halberdiers, bearing
      torches, remained without.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must request your grace to follow me," said Brydges.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither?" demanded Elizabeth, rising. "To the queen's presence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the council?" pursued the princess,&mdash;"or to execution? No matter.
      I am ready." And she motioned the lieutenant to lead on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas Brydges obeyed, and followed by the princess, traversed the
      gallery, descended the great staircase, and entered a spacious chamber on
      the ground floor. Here he paused for a moment, while a sliding panel in
      the wall was opened, through which he and his companion passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short flight of stone steps brought them to a dark narrow passage, and
      they proceeded silently and slowly along it, until their progress was
      checked by a strong iron door, which was unfastened and closed behind them
      by Nightgall. The jarring of the heavy bolts, as they were shot into their
      sockets, resounded hollowly along the arched roof of the passage, and
      smote forcibly upon Elizabeth's heart, and she required all her
      constitutional firmness to support her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now in one of those subterranean galleries, often described
      before, on either side of which were cells, and the clangour called forth
      many a dismal response. Presently afterwards, they arrived at the head of
      a staircase, which Elizabeth descended, and found herself, in the
      torture-chamber. A dreadful spectacle met her gaze. At one side of the
      room, which was lighted by a dull lamp from the roof, and furnished as
      before with numberless hideous implements&mdash;each seeming to have been
      recently employed&mdash;sat, or rather was supported, a wretched man upon
      whom every refinement of torture had evidently been practised. A cloak was
      thrown over his lower limbs, but his ghastly and writhen features proved
      the extremity of suffering to which he had been subjected. Elizabeth could
      scarcely believe that in this miserable object, whom it would have been a
      mercy to despatch, she beheld the once bold and haughty Sir Thomas Wyat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placed on the corner of a leathern couch, and supported by Wolfytt and
      Sorrocold, the latter of whom bathed his temples with some restorative,
      Wyat fixed his heavy eyes upon the princess. But her attention was
      speedily diverted from him to another person, whose presence checked her
      feelings. This was the queen, who stood on one side, with Gardiner and
      Renard. Opposite them was Courtenay, with his arms folded upon his breast.
      The latter looked up as Elizabeth entered the chamber; and after gazing at
      her for a moment, turned his regards, with an irrepressible shudder, to
      Wyat. Knowing that her safety depended upon her firmness, though her heart
      bled for the tortured man, Elizabeth disguised all appearance of
      compassion, and throwing herself at the queen's feet, cried, "Heaven bless
      your highness, for granting me this interview! I can now prove my
      innocence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?" demanded Mary coldly. "It would indeed rejoice me to find I
      have been deceived. But I cannot shut my ears to the truth. Yon traitor,"
      she continued, pointing to Wyat, "who dared to rise in arms against his
      sovereign, distinctly charges you with participation in his rebellious
      designs. I have his confession, taken from his own lips, and signed with
      his own hand, wherein he affirms, by his hopes of mercy from the Supreme
      Judge before whom he will shortly appear to answer for his offences, that
      you encouraged his plans for my dethronement, and sought to win the crown
      for yourself, in order to bestow it with your hand upon your lover,
      Courtenay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is false," cried Elizabeth;&mdash;"false as the caitiff who invented
      it&mdash;false as the mischievous councillor who stands beside you, and
      who trusts to work my ruin,&mdash;but, by our father's soul it shall go
      hard if I do not requite him! Your majesty has not a more loyal subject
      than myself, nor has any of your subjects a more loving sister. This
      wretched Wyat, whose condition would move my pity were he not so heinous a
      traitor, may have written to me, but, on my faith, I have never received
      his letters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Russell's son declares that he delivered them into your own hands,"
      observed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another he, as false as the first," replied Elizabeth. "It is a plot,
      your highness&mdash;a contrivance of my enemy, Simon Renard. Where is Lord
      Russell's son? Why is he not here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall see him anon, since you desire it," replied Mary. "Like
      yourself, he is a prisoner in the Tower. But these assertions do not clear
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness says you have Wyat's confession," rejoined Elizabeth. "What
      faith is to be attached to it? It has been wrung from him by the severity
      of the torture to which he has been subjected. Look at his shattered
      frame, and say whether it is not likely he would purchase relief from such
      suffering as he must have endured at any cost. The sworn tormentors are
      here. Let them declare how often they have stretched him on the rack&mdash;how
      often applied the thumbscrew,&mdash;how often delivered him to the deadly
      embraces of the scavenger's daughter, before this false charge was wrung
      from him. Speak, fellows! how often have you racked him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the tormentors did not dare to reply. A stifled groan broke from Wyat,
      and a sharp convulsion passed over his frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question has only extorted the truth," observed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the accusation so obtained be availing, the retraction must be equally
      so," replied Elizabeth. "Sir Thomas Wyat," she exclaimed, in aloud and
      authoritative tone, and stepping towards him, "if you would not render
      your name for ever infamous, you will declare my innocence."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      The sufferer gazed at her, as if he did not clearly comprehend what was
      said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth repeated the command, and in a more peremptory tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I declared against you?" asked Wyat, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have accused me of countenancing your traitorous practices against
      the queen's highness, who now stands before you," rejoined Elizabeth. "You
      well know it is false. Do not die with such a stain upon your knighthood
      and your honour. The worst is over. Further application of the rack would
      be fatal, and it will not be resorted to, because you would thus escape
      the scaffold. You can have, therefore, no object in adhering to this vile
      fabrication of my enemies. Retract your words, I command you, and declare
      my innocence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," replied Wyat, in a firm tone. "I have falsely accused you, and was
      induced to do so in the hope of pardon. I unsay all I have said, and will
      die proclaiming your innocence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," replied Elizabeth, with a triumphant glance at the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Place me at the feet of the princess," said Wyat to his supporters. "Your
      pardon, madam," he added, as the order was obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have it," replied Elizabeth, scarcely able to repress her emotion.
      "May God forgive you, as I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then your former declaration was false, thou perjured traitor?" cried
      Mary, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I have said, I have said," rejoined Wyat; "what I now say is the
      truth." And he motioned the attendants to raise him, the pain of kneeling
      being too exquisite for endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will adhere to your declaration?" pursued Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my last breath," gasped Wyat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At whose instigation were you induced to charge the princess with
      conspiring with you?" demanded Renard, stepping forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At yours," returned Wyat, with a look of intense hatred. "You, who have
      deceived the queen&mdash;deceived me&mdash;and would deceive the devil
      your master, if you could&mdash;you urged me to it&mdash;you&mdash;ha!
      ha!" And with a convulsive attempt at laughter, which communicated a
      horrible expression to his features, he sank into the arms of Wolfytt, and
      was conveyed to a cell at the back of the chamber, the door of which was
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My innocence is established," said Elizabeth, turning to the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not entirely," answered Mary. "Wyat's first charge was supported by Lord
      Russell's son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me to him, or send for him hither," rejoined Elizabeth. "He has been
      suborned, like Wyat, by Renard. I will stake my life that he denies it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not refute the idle charge brought against me," observed Renard,
      who had been for a moment confounded by Wyat's accusation. "Your majesty
      will at once discern its utter groundlessness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask no clemency for myself," interposed Courtenay, speaking for the
      first time; "but I beseech your highness not to let the words of that
      false and crafty Spaniard weigh against your sister. From his perfidious
      counsels all these disasters have originated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would screen the princess in the hope of obtaining her hand, my
      lord," replied Mary. "I see through your purpose, and will defeat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far from it," replied the Earl, "I here solemnly renounce all
      pretensions to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Courtenay!" exclaimed Elizabeth, in a tone of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Recent events have cured me of love and ambition," pursued the Earl,
      without regarding her. "All I desire is freedom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is it for one so unworthy that I have entertained this regard?" cried
      Elizabeth. "But I am rightly punished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are so," replied Mary, bitterly. "And you now taste some of the pangs
      you inflicted upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me, gracious madam," cried Courtenay, prostrating himself before the
      queen. "I have avowed thus much, that you may attach due credit to what I
      am about to declare concerning Renard. My heart was yours, and yours only,
      till I allowed myself to be influenced by him. I knew not then his design,
      but it has since been fully revealed. It was to disgust you with me that
      he might accomplish the main object of his heart&mdash;the match with the
      prince of Spain. He succeeded too well. Utterly inexperienced, I readily
      yielded to the allurements he spread before me. My indiscretions were
      reported to you. But, failing in alienating me from your regard, he tried
      a deeper game, and chose out as his tool, the princess Elizabeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" exclaimed Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He it was," pursued Courtenay, "who first attracted my attention towards
      her&mdash;who drew invidious comparisons between her youthful charms and
      your Majesty's more advanced age. He it was, who hinted at the possibility
      of an alliance between us&mdash;who led me on step by step till I was
      completely enmeshed. I will own it, I became desperately enamoured of the
      princess. I thought no more of your highness&mdash;of the brilliant
      prospects lost to me; and, blinded by my passion, became reckless of the
      perilous position in which I placed myself. But now that I can look calmly
      behind me, I see where, and why I fell&mdash;and I fully comprehend the
      tempter's motives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What says your excellency to this?" demanded Mary, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much that the Earl of Devonshire has asserted is true," replied Renard.
      "But in rescuing your majesty, at any cost, from so unworthy an alliance,
      I deserve your thanks, rather than your reprobation. And I shall ever
      rejoice that I have succeeded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have succeeded at my expense, and at the expense of many of my
      bravest and best subjects," replied Mary, severely. "But the die is cast,
      and cannot be recalled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," replied Renard, with a smile of malignant satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will your highness pursue your investigations further tonight?" demanded
      Gardiner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the queen, who appeared lost in thought. "Let the Princess
      Elizabeth be taken back to the Bell Tower, and Courtenay to his prison in
      the Bowyer Tower. I will consider upon their sentence. Wyat is respited
      for the present. I shall interrogate him further."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, she quitted the torture-chamber with her train, and the
      prisoners were removed as she had directed.

      XXXV.&mdash;-HOW XIT DISCOVERED THE SECRET OF HIS BIRTH; AND HOW HE WAS
      KNIGHTED UNDER THE TITLE OF SIR NARCISSUS LE GRAND.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ife is full of the
      saddest and the strongest contrasts. The laugh of derision succeeds the
      groan of despair&mdash;the revel follows the funeral&mdash;the moment that
      ushers the new-born babe into existence, is the last, perchance, of its
      parent&mdash;without the prison walls, all is sunshine and happiness&mdash;within,
      gloom and despair. But throughout the great city which it commanded,
      search where you might, no stronger contrasts of rejoicing and despair
      could be found, than were now to be met with in the Tower of London.
      While, on the one hand, every dungeon was crowded, and scarcely an hour
      passed that some miserable sufferer did not expire under the hand of the
      secret tormentor, or the public executioner; on the other, there was
      mirth, revelry, and all the customary celebrations of victory. As upon
      Mary's former triumph over her enemies, a vast fire was lighted in the
      centre of the Tower Green, and four oxen, roasted whole at it, were
      distributed, together with a proportionate supply of bread, and a measure
      of ale or mead, in rations, to every soldier in the fortress; and as may
      be supposed, the utmost joviality prevailed. To each warder was allotted
      an angel of gold, and a dish from the royal table; while to the three
      giants were given the residue of a grand banquet, a butt of Gascoign wine,
      and, in consideration of their valiant conduct during the siege, their
      yearly fee, by the queen's command, was trebled. On the night of these
      festivities, a magnificent display of fireworks took place on the Green,
      and an extraordinary illumination was effected by means of a row of
      barrels filled with pitch, ranged along the battlements of the White
      Tower, which being suddenly lighted, cast forth a glare that illumined the
      whole fortress, and was seen at upwards of twenty miles' distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not unmindful of the queen's promise, Xit, though unable to find a
      favourable opportunity of claiming it, did not fail to assume all the
      consequence of his anticipated honours. He treated those with whom he
      associated with the utmost haughtiness; and though his arrogant demeanour
      only excited the merriment of the giants, it drew many a sharp retort, and
      not a few blows, from such as were not disposed to put up with his
      insolence. The subject that perpetually occupied his thoughts, was the
      title he ought to assume;&mdash;for he was thoroughly dissatisfied with
      his present appellation. "Base and contemptible name!" he exclaimed. "How
      I loathe it!&mdash;and how did I acquire it? It was bestowed upon me, I
      suppose, in my infancy, by Og, to whose care I was committed. A mystery
      hangs over my birth. I must unravel it. Let me see:&mdash;Two-and-twenty
      years ago, (come Martinmas,) I was deposited at the door of the Byward
      Tower in a piece of blanket!&mdash;unworthy swaddling-cloth for so
      illustrious an infant&mdash;a circumstance which fully proves that my
      noble parents were anxious for concealment. Stay! I have heard of
      changelings&mdash;of elfin children left by fairies in the room of those
      they steal. Can I be such a one? A shudder crosses my frame at the bare
      idea. And yet my activity, my daring, my high mental qualities, my
      unequalled symmetry of person, small though it be&mdash;all these seem to
      warrant the supposition. Yes! I am a changeling. I am a fairy child. Yet
      hold! this will not do. Though I may entertain these notions in secret of
      my alliance with the invisible world, they will not be accepted by the
      incredulous multitude. I must have some father, probable, or improbable.
      Who could he have been? Or who <i>might</i> he have been? Let me see. Sir
      Thomas More was imprisoned in the Tower about the time of my birth. Could
      I not be his son? It is more than probable. So was the Bishop of
      Rochester. But to claim descent from him would bring scandal, upon the
      church. Besides, he was a Catholic prelate. No, it must be Sir Thomas
      More. That will account for my wit. Then about the same time there were
      the Lord Darcy; and Robert Salisbury, Abbot of Vale Crucis; the Prior of
      Doncaster; Sir Thomas Percy; Sir Francis Bygate; and Sir John Bulmer. All
      these were prisoners, so that I have plenty to choose from. I will go and
      consult Og. I wonder whether he has kept the piece of blanket in which I
      was wrapped. It will be a gross omission if he has not."
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing soliloquy occurred in one of the galleries of the palace,
      where the vain-glorious mannikin was lingering in the hope of being
      admitted to the royal presence. No sooner did the idea of consulting Og on
      the subject of his birth occur to him, than he set off to the By-ward
      Tower, where he found the two unmarried giants employed upon a huge
      smoking dish of baked meat, and, notwithstanding his importunity, neither
      of them appeared willing to attend to him. Thus baffled, and his appetite
      sharpened by the savoury odour of the viands, Xit seized a knife and fork,
      and began to ply them with great zeal. The meal over, and two ponderous
      jugs that flanked the board emptied of their contents, Og leaned his huge
      frame against the wall, and in a drowsy tone informed the dwarf that he
      was ready to listen to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No sleeping, then, my master," cried Xit, springing upon his knee, and
      tweaking his nose. "I have a matter of the utmost importance to consult
      you about. You must be wide awake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? replied the good-humoured giant, yawning as if he would have
      swallowed the teazing mannikin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It relates to my origin," replied Xit. "Am I the son of a nobleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should rather say you were the offspring of some ape escaped from the
      menagerie," answered Og, bursting into a roar of laughter, in which he was
      joined by Gog, much to the discomfiture of the cause of their merriment.
      "You have all the tricks-of the species."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dare to repeat that insinuation, base Titan," cried Xit, furiously, and
      drawing his sword, "and I will be thy death. I am as illustriously
      descended as thyself, and on both sides too, whereas thy mother was a
      frowzy fish-wife. Know that I am the son of Sir Thomas More."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Thomas More!" echoed both giants, laughing more immoderately than
      ever. "What has put that notion into thy addle pate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My better genius," replied Xit, "and unless you can show me who <i>was</i>
      my father, I shall claim descent from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will only expose yourself to ridicule," returned Og, patting the
      mannikin's shock head&mdash;a familiarity which he resented,&mdash;"and
      though I and my brethren laugh at you, and make a jest of you, we do not
      desire others to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once graced by knighthood, no man, be he of my stature or of yours, my
      overgrown master, shall make a jest of me with impunity," replied Xit,
      proudly. "But since you think I am <i>not</i> the son of Sir Thomas More,
      from whom can I safely claim descent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would willingly assist you to a father," replied Og, smothering a
      laugh, "but on my faith, I can think of none more probable than Hairun's
      pet monkey, or perhaps old Max."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anger me not," shrieked Xit, in extremity of fury, "or you will rue it.
      What has become of the blanket in which I was wrapped?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The blanket!" exclaimed Og, "why, it was a strip scarcely bigger than my
      hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it lost?" demanded Xit, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear so," replied Og. "Stay! now I recollect, I patched an old pair of
      hose with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patched a pair of hose with it!" cried Xit. "You deserve to go in tatters
      during the rest of your days. You have destroyed the sole clue to my
      origin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, if that blanket will guide you, I have taken the best means of
      preserving it," rejoined Og;&mdash;"for I think I have the hose still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are they?" inquired Xit. "Let me see them instantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they still exist, they are in a large chest in the upper chamber,"
      replied Og. "But be not too much elated, for I fear we shall be
      disappointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, let us search without a moment's delay," rejoined Xit,
      jumping down, and hurrying up the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was followed somewhat more leisurely by the two giants, and the trunk
      was found crammed under a heap of lumber into an embrasure. The key was
      lost, but as Xit's impatience would not allow him to wait to have it
      unfastened by a smith, Og forced it open with the head of a halbert. It
      contained a number of old buskins, cloaks of all hues and fashions,
      doublets, pantoufles, caps, buff-boots and hose. Of the latter there were
      several pair, and though many were threadbare enough, it did not appear
      that any were patched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit, who had plunged into the trunk to examine each article, was greatly
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear they are lost," observed Og.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would seem so," replied Xit, "for there are only a doublet and cloak
      left. Oh! that a worshipful knight's history should hang on so slight a
      tenure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many a knight's history has hung on less," replied Gog. "But what have we
      rolled up in that corner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I live, a pair of watchet-coloured hose," cried Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very pair we are in quest of," rejoined Og. "Unfold them, and you
      will find the piece of blanket in the seat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Xit obeyed, and mounting on the side of the box held out the huge
      garments, and there, undoubtedly in the region intimated by Og, was a
      piece of dirty flannel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this, then, was my earliest covering," apostrophised Xit. "In this
      fragment of woollen cloth my tender limbs were swathed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly were they," replied Og, laughing. "And when I first beheld thee it
      was ample covering. But what light does it throw upon thy origin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That remains to be seen," returned Xit. And unsheathing his dagger he
      began to unrip the piece of flannel from the garment in which it was
      stitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two giants watched his proceedings in silence, and glanced
      significantly at each other. At length, Xit tore it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a labour in vain," observed Og.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," replied Xit. "See you not that this corner is doubled over.
      There is a name worked within it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The imp is right," cried Og. "How came I to overlook it." And he would
      have snatched the flannel from Xit, but the dwarf darted away, crying, "No
      one shall have a hand in the discovery but myself. Stand off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling with eagerness, he then cut open the corner, and found, worked
      withinside, the words: <i>NARCISSUS LE GRAND</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Narcissus Le Grand!" exclaimed Xit, triumphantly. "That was my father's
      title. He must have been a nobleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that was your father's name," returned Gog, "and I begin to think you
      have stumbled upon the right person at last, he was a Frenchman, and groom
      of the pantry to Queen Anne Boleyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was a dwarf like yourself," added Og, "and though the ugliest being I
      ever beheld, had extraordinary personal vanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In which respect he mightily resembled his son," laughed Gog; "and since
      we have found out the father, I think I can give a shrewd guess at the
      mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope she was a person of distinction?" cried Xit, whose countenance had
      fallen at the knowledge he had acquired of his paternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was a scullion," replied Gog,&mdash;"by name Mab Leather-barrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A scullion!" ejaculated Xit, indignantly. "I, the son of a scullion,&mdash;and
      of one so basely-named as Leatherbarrow&mdash;impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am as sure of it as of my existence," replied Og. "Your mother was not
      a jot taller, or more well-favoured than your father; and they both, I now
      remember, disappeared about the time you were found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which name will you adopt&mdash;Le Grand, or Leatherbarrow?" demanded
      Gog, maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is an unlucky discovery," thought Xit. "I had better have left my
      parentage alone. The son of a groom of the pantry and a scullion. What a
      degrading conjunction! However, I will make the most of it, and not let
      them have the laugh against me. I shall assume my father's name," he added
      aloud&mdash;"Sir Narcissus Le Grand&mdash;and a good, well-sounding title
      it is, as need be desired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to be hoped all will have forgotten the former bearer of it,"
      laughed Og.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not who remembers it," replied Xit; "the name bespeaks noble
      descent. Call me in future Narcissus Le Grand. The title fits me exactly,&mdash;Narcissus
      expressing my personal accomplishments&mdash;Le Grand my majesty. For the
      present, you may put 'master' to my name. You will shortly have to use a
      more honourable style of address. Farewell, sirs."
    </p>
    <p>
      And thrusting the piece of flannel into his doublet, he strutted to the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, sweet Master Narcissus," cried Og.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, Leatherbarrow," added Gog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Le Grand," corrected Xit, halting, with a dignified air; "Le Grand,
      henceforth, is my name." And he marched off with his head so erect that,
      unfortunately missing his footing, he tumbled down the staircase. Picking
      himself up before the giants, whose laughter enraged him, could reach him,
      he darted off, and did not return till a late hour, when they had retired
      to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days after this discovery,&mdash;the queen being then at the Tower,&mdash;as
      he was pacing the grand gallery of the palace, according to custom, an
      usher tapped him on the shoulder, and desired him to follow him. With a
      throbbing heart Xit obeyed, and, putting all the dignity he could command
      into his deportment, entered the presence-chamber. On that very morning,
      as good luck would have it, his tailor had brought him his new
      habiliments; and arrayed in a purple velvet mantle lined with
      carnation-coloured silk, a crimson doublet slashed with white,
      orange-tawny hose, yellow buskins fringed with gold, and a green velvet
      cap, decorated with a plume of ostrich feathers, and looped with a diamond
      aigrette, he cut, in his own opinion, no despicable figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the dwarf had entertained any doubts as to why he was summoned they
      would have been dispersed at once, as he advanced, by observing that the
      three giants stood at a little distance from the queen, and that she was
      attended only by a few dames of honour, her female jester, and the
      vice-chamberlain, Sir John Gage, who held a crimson velvet cushion, on
      which was laid a richly-ornamented sword. A smile crossed the queen's
      countenance as Xit drew nigh, and an irrepressible titter spread among the
      dames of honour. Arrived within a few yards of the throne, the mannikin
      prostrated himself as gracefully as he could. But he was destined to
      mishaps. And in this the most important moment of his life, his sword,
      which was of extraordinary length, got between his legs, and he was
      compelled to remove it before his knee would touch the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have not forgotten our promise&mdash;rash though it was," observed
      Mary, "and have summoned thy comrades to be witness to the distinction we
      are about to confer upon thee. In the heat of the siege, we promised that
      whoso would bring us Bret, alive or dead, should have his request, be it
      what it might. Thou wert his captor, and thou askest&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knighthood at your majesty's hands," supplied Xit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How shall we name thee?" demanded Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Narcissus Le Grand," replied the dwarf. "I am called familiarly Xit. But
      it is a designation by which I do not desire to be longer distinguished."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary took the sword from Sir John Gage, and placing it upon the dwarf's
      shoulder, said, "Arise, Sir Narcissus."
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-made knight immediately obeyed, and making a profound reverence to
      the queen, was about to retire, when she checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tarry a moment, Sir Narcissus," she said. "I have a further favour to
      bestow upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" cried the dwarf, out of his senses with delight. "I pray your
      majesty to declare it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will need a dame," returned the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a truth," replied Sir Narcissus, tenderly ogling the bevy of beauties
      behind the throne, "I need one sadly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will choose for you," said the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness's condescension overwhelms me," rejoined Sir Narcissus,
      wondering which would fall to his share.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This shall be your bride," continued the queen, pointing to Jane the
      Fool, "and I will give her a portion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Narcissus had some ado to conceal his mortification. Receiving the
      announcement with the best grace he could assume, he strutted up to Jane,
      and taking her hand, said, "You hear her highness's injunctions,
      sweetheart. You are to be Lady Le Grand. I need not ask your consent, I
      presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall never have it," replied Jane the Fool, with a coquettish toss
      of the head, "if her highness did not command it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall require to exert my authority early," thought Sir Narcissus, "or
      I shall share the fate of Magog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, myself, will fix the day for your espousals," observed Mary.
      "Meanwhile, you have my permission to woo your intended bride for a few
      minutes in each day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Only</i> a few minutes!" cried Sir Narcissus, with affected
      disappointment. "I could dispense with even that allowance," he added to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot reward your services as richly," continued Mary, addressing the
      gigantic brethren, "but I am not unmindful of them,&mdash;nor shall they
      pass unrequited. Whenever you have a boon to ask, hesitate not to address
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three giants bowed their lofty heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A purse of gold will be given to each of you," continued the queen; "and
      on the day of his marriage, I shall bestow a like gift upon Sir
      Narcissus." She then waved her hand, and the new-made knight and his
      companions withdrew.

      XXXVI.&mdash;HOW CHOLMONDELEY LEARNT THE HISTORY OF CICELY; HOW NIGHTGALL
      ATTEMPTED TO ASSASSINATE RENARD; AND OF THE TERRIBLE FATE THAT BEFEL HIM.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>uthbert
      Cholmondeley, after upwards of a week's solitary confinement, underwent a
      rigorous examination by certain of the Council relative to his own share
      in the conspiracy, and his knowledge of the different parties connected
      with it. He at once admitted that he had taken a prominent part in the
      siege, but refused to answer any other questions. "I confess myself guilty
      of treason and rebellion against the queen's highness," he said, "and I
      ask no further mercy than a speedy death. But if the word of one standing
      in peril of his life may be taken, I solemnly declare, and call upon you
      to attest my declaration,&mdash;that the Lady Jane Grey is innocent of all
      share in the recent insurrection. For a long time, she was kept in total
      ignorance of the project, and when it came to her knowledge, she used
      every means, short of betraying it,&mdash;tears, entreaties, menaces,&mdash;to
      induce her husband to abandon the design."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This declaration will not save her," replied Sir Edward Hastings, who was
      one of the interrogators, sternly,&mdash;"By not revealing the conspiracy,
      she acquiesced in it. Her first duty was to her sovereign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of it, and so is the unfortunate lady herself," replied
      Cholmondeley. "But I earnestly entreat you, in pity for her misfortunes,
      to report what I have said to the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not fail to do so," returned Hastings; "but I will not deceive
      you. Her fate is sealed. And now, touching the Princess Elizabeth's share
      in this unhappy affair. Do you know aught concerning it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever," replied Cholmondeley; "and if I did, I would not
      reveal it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take heed what you say, sir," rejoined Sir Thomas Brydges, who was
      likewise among the examiners, "or I shall order you to be more sharply
      questioned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall heard this menace with savage exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rack will wrest nothing from me," said Cholmondeley, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brydges immediately sat down at a table, and writing out a list of
      questions to be put to the prisoner, added an order for the torture, and
      delivered it to Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without giving Cholmondeley time to reflect upon his imprudence, the
      jailor hurried him away, and he did not pause till he came to the head of
      the stairs leading to the torture-chamber. On reaching the steps,
      Nightgall descended first, but though he opened the door with great
      caution, a glare of lurid light burst forth, and a dismal groan smote the
      ears of the listener. It was followed by a creaking noise, the meaning of
      which the esquire too well divined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some little time elapsed before the door was again opened, and the voice
      of Nightgall was heard from below calling to his attendants to bring down
      the prisoner. The first object that caught Cholmondeley's gaze on entering
      the fatal chamber, was a figure, covered from head to foot in a
      blood-coloured cloth. The sufferer, whoever he was, had just been released
      from the torture, as two assistants were supporting him, while Wolfytt was
      arranging the ropes on the rack. Sorrocold, also, who held a small cup
      filled with some pungent-smelling liquid, and a sprinkling-brush in his
      hand, was directing the assistants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horror-stricken at the sight, and filled with the conviction from the
      mystery observed, and the stature of the veiled person, that it was Lord
      Guilford Dudley, Cholmondeley uttered his name in a tone of piercing
      anguish. At the cry, the figure was greatly agitated&mdash;the arms
      struggled&mdash;and it was evident that an effort was made to speak. But
      only an inarticulate sound could be heard. The attendants looked
      disconcerted, and Nightgall stamping his foot angrily, ordered them to
      take their charge away. But Cholmondeley perceiving their intention, broke
      from those about him, and throwing himself at the feet of him whom he
      supposed to be Dudley, cried&mdash;"My dear, dear lord, it is I, your
      faithful esquire, Cuthbert Cholmondeley. Make some sign, if I am right in
      supposing it to be you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure struggled violently, and shaking off the officials, raised the
      cloth, and disclosed the countenance of the unfortunate nobleman&mdash;but
      oil! how changed since Cholmondeley had seen him last&mdash;how ghastly,
      how distorted, how death-like, were his features!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You here!" cried Dudley. "Where is Jane? Has she fled? Has she escaped?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has surrendered herself," replied Cholmondeley, "in the hope of
      obtaining your pardon.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "False hope!&mdash;delusive expectation!" exclaimed Dudley, in a tone of
      the bitterest anguish. "She will share my fate. I could have died happy&mdash;could
      have defied these engines, if she had escaped&mdash;but now!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Away with him!" interposed Nightgall. "Throw the cloth over his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh God! I am her destroyer!" shrieked Dudley, as the order was obeyed,
      and he was forced out of the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley was then seized by Wolfytt and the others, and thrown upon
      his back on the floor. He made no resistance, well knowing it would be
      useless; and he determined, even if he should expire under the torture, to
      let no expression of anguish escape him. He had need of all his fortitude;
      for the sharpness of the suffering to which he was subjected by the
      remorseless Nightgall, was such as few could have withstood. But not a
      groan burst from him, though his whole frame seemed rent asunder by the
      dreadful tension.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on," cried Nightgall, finding that Wolfytt and the others paused.
      "Turn the rollers round once more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will wrench his bones from their sockets,&mdash;he will expire if you
      do," observed Sorrocold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No matter," replied Nightgall; "I have an order to question him sharply,
      and I will do so, at all hazards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so at your own responsibility, then," replied Sorrocold, retiring. "I
      tell you he will die if you strain him further."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, I say," thundered Nightgall. But as he spoke, the sufferer
      fainted, and Wolfytt refused to comply with the jailor's injunctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley was taken off the engine. Restoratives were applied by
      Sorrocold, and the questions proposed by the lieutenant put to him by
      Nightgall. But he returned no answer; and uttering an angry exclamation at
      his obstinacy, the jailor ordered him to be taken back to his cell, where
      he was thrown upon a heap of straw, and left without light or food.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time, Cholmondeley remained in a state of insensibility, and when
      he recovered, it was to endure far greater agony than he had experienced
      on the rack. His muscles were so strained that he was unable to move, and
      every bone in his body appeared broken. The thought, however, that Cicely
      was alive, and in the power of his hated rival, tormented him more sharply
      than his bodily suffering. Supposing her dead, though his heart was ever
      constant to her memory, and though he was a prey to deep and severe grief,
      yet the whirl of events in which he had been recently engaged had
      prevented him from dwelling altogether upon her loss. But now, when he
      knew that she still lived, and was in the power of Nightgall, all his
      passion&mdash;all his jealousy, returned with tenfold fury. The most
      dreadful suspicions crossed him; and his mental anguish was so great as to
      be almost intolerable. While thus tortured in body and mind, the door of
      his cell was opened, and Nightgall entered, dragging after him a female.
      The glare of the lamp so dazzled Cholmondeley's weakened vision, that he
      involuntarily closed his eyes. But what was his surprise to hear his own
      name pronounced by well-known accents, and, as soon as he could steady his
      gaze, to behold the features of Cicely&mdash;but so pale, so emaciated,
      that he could scarcely recognise them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There," cried Nightgall, with a look of fiendish exultation, pointing to
      Cholmondeley. "I told you you should sec your lover. Glut your eyes with
      the sight. The arms that should have clasped you are nerveless&mdash;the
      eyes that gazed so passionately upon you, dim&mdash;the limbs that won
      your admiration, crippled. Look at him&mdash;and for the last time. And
      let him gaze on you, and see whether in these death-pale features&mdash;in
      this wasted form, there are any remains of the young and blooming maiden
      that won his heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cicely," cried Cholmondeley, making an ineffectual attempt to rise, "do I
      indeed behold you? I thought you dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would I were so," she cried, kneeling beside him, "rather than what I am.
      And to see you thus&mdash;and without the power to relieve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You <i>can</i> relieve me of the worst pang I endure," returned
      Cholmondeley. "You have been long in the power of that miscreant&mdash;exposed
      to his violence, his ill-usage, to the worst of villany. Has he dared to
      abuse his power? Do not deceive me! Has he wronged you?&mdash;Are you his
      minion? Speak! And the answer will either kill me at once, or render my
      death on the scaffold happy. Speak! Speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am yours, and yours only&mdash;in life or death, dear Cholmondeley,"
      replied Cicely. "Neither entreaties nor force should make me his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The time is come when I will show you no further consideration," observed
      Nightgall, moodily. "And if the question your lover has just asked, is
      repeated, it shall be differently answered. You shall be mine to-morrow,
      either by your own free consent, or by force. I have spared you thus long,
      in the hope that you would relent, and not compel me to have recourse to
      means I would willingly avoid. Now, hear me. I have brought you hither to
      gratify my vengeance upon the miserable wretch, writhing at my feet, who
      has robbed me of your affections, and whose last moments I would embitter
      by the certainty that you are in my power. But though it will be much to
      me to forego the promised gratification of witnessing his execution, or
      knowing that he will be executed, yet I will purchase your compliance even
      at this price. Swear to wed me to-morrow, and to accompany me
      unresistingly whithersoever I may choose to take you, and, in return, I
      swear to free him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He made a like proposal once before, Cicely," cried the esquire. "Reject
      it. Let us die together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It matters little to me how you decide," cried Nightgall. "Mine you shall
      be, come what will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear what he says, Cholmondeley," cried Cicely, distractedly. "I
      cannot escape him. Oh, let me save you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!" rejoined Cholmondeley, trying to stretch his hands towards her.
      "Never! You torture me by this hesitation. Reject it, if you love me,
      positively&mdash;peremptorily!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Heaven direct me!" cried Cicely, falling upon her knees. "If I
      refuse, I am your destroyer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will utterly destroy me, if you yield," groaned Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once wedded to me," urged Nightgall, "you shall set him free yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no, no!" cried Cicely. "Death were better than that. I cannot
      consent. Cholmondelcy, you must die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bid me live," returned the esquire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have signed his death-warrant!" cried Nightgall, seizing her hand.
      "Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will die here," shrieked Cicely, struggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Villain!" cried Cholmondeloy, "your cruelty will turn her brain, as it
      did that of her mother Alexia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know Alexia was her mother?" demanded Nightgall, starting, and
      relinquishing his grasp of Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of it," replied Cholmondeley. "And, what is more, I am
      acquainted with the rightful name and title of your victim. She was the
      wife of Sir Alberic Mountjoy, who was attainted of heresy and high
      treason, in the reign of Henry the Eighth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not deny it," replied Nightgall. "She was so. But how did you
      learn this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Partly, from an inscription upon a small silver clasp, which I found upon
      her hood when I discovered her body in the Devilin Tower," replied
      Cholmondeley; "and partly, from inquiries since made. I have ascertained
      that the Lady Mountjoy was imprisoned with her husband in the Tower; and
      that at the time of his execution she received a pardon. I would learn
      from you why she was subsequently detained?&mdash;why she was called
      Alexia?&mdash;and why her child was taken from her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She lost her senses on the day of her husbands death," replied Nightgall.
      "I will tell you nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" cried Cicely, who had listened with breathless interest to what
      was said, "hers was a tragical history."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours will be still more tragical, if you continue obstinate," rejoined
      Nightgall. "Come along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven preserve me from this monster!" she shrieked. "Help me,
      Cholmondeley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am powerless as a crushed worm," groaned the esquire, in a tone of
      anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall laughed exultingly, and twining his arms around Cicely, held his
      hand over her mouth to stifle her cries, and forced her from the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharpest pang he had recently endured was light to Cholmondeley,
      compared with his present maddening sensations, and had not insensibility
      relieved him, his reason would have given way. How long he remained in
      this state he knew not, but, on reviving, he found himself placed on a
      small pallet, and surrounded by three men, in sable dresses. His attire
      had been removed, and two of these persons were chafing his limbs with an
      ointment, which had a marvellous effect in subduing the pain, and
      restoring pliancy to the sinews and joints; while the third, who was no
      other than Sorrocold, bathed his temples with a pungent liquid. In a short
      time, he felt himself greatly restored, and able to move; and when he
      thought how valuable the strength he had thus suddenly and mysteriously
      acquired would have been a short time ago, he groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him a cup of wine,'" said an authoritative voice, which Cholmondeley
      fancied he recognised, from the further end of the cell. And glancing in
      the direction of the speaker, he beheld Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be dangerous, your excellency," returned Sorrocold.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dangerous or not, he shall have it," rejoined Renard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And wine was accordingly poured out by one of the attendants, and
      presented to the esquire, who eagerly drained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now leave us," said Renard; "and return to the torture-chamber. I will
      rejoin you there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sorrocold and his companions bowed, and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard then proceeded to interrogate Cholmondeley respecting his own share
      in the rebellion; and also concerning Dudley and Lady Jane. Failing in
      obtaining satisfactory answers, he turned his inquiries to Elizabeth's
      participation in the plot; and he shaped them so artfully, that he
      contrived to elicit from the esquire, whose brain was a good deal confused
      by the potent draught he had swallowed, some important particulars
      relative to the princess's correspondence with Wyat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied with the result of the examination, the ambassador turned to
      depart, when he beheld, close behind him, a masked figure, which he
      immediately recognised as the same that had appeared at the window of his
      lodgings in the Bloody Tower, on the evening when Jane's death-warrant was
      signed by the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sound had proclaimed the mask's approach, and the door was shut. The
      sight revived all Renard's superstitious fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, and what art thou?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your executioner," replied a hollow voice. And suddenly drawing a
      poniard, the mask aimed a terrible blow at Renard, which, if he had not
      avoided it, must have proved fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus assaulted, Renard tried to draw his sword, but he was prevented by
      the mask, who grappled with him, and brought him to the ground. In the
      struggle, however, the assassin's vizard fell off, and disclosed the
      features of Nightgall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nightgall!" exclaimed Renard. "You, then, were the mysterious visitant to
      my chamber in the Bloody Tower. I might have guessed as much when I met
      you in the passage. But you persuaded me I had seen an apparition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your excellency took me for a ghost, I took you for something worse,"
      replied Nightgall, keeping his knee upon the ambassador's chest, and
      searching for his dagger, which had dropped in the conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Release me, villain!" cried Renard. "Would you murder me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am paid to put your excellency to death," rejoined Nightgall, with the
      utmost coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will give you twice the sum to spare me," rejoined Renard, who saw from
      Nightgall's looks that he had no chance, unless he could work upon his
      avarice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!" exclaimed the jailor; who, not being able to reach his dagger,
      which had rolled to some distance, had drawn his sword, and was now
      shortening it, with intent to plunge it in the other's throat&mdash;"I
      would take your offer&mdash;but I have gone too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing," gasped Renard, giving himself up for lost. "I swear by my
      patron, Saint Paul, that I will not harm a hair of your head. Against your
      employer only will I direct my vengeance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not trust you," replied Nightgall, about to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as he was about to deal the fatal blow&mdash;at the very moment
      that the point of the blade pierced the ambassador's skin, he was plucked
      backwards by Cholmondeley, and hurled on the ground. Perceiving it was his
      rival, who was more hateful to him even than Renard, Cholmondeley, on the
      onset, had prepared to take some part in the struggle, and noticing the
      poniard, had first of all possessed himself of it, and then attacked
      Nightgall in the manner above related.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing himself upon his foe, Cholmondeley tried to stab him; but it
      appeared that he wore a stout buff jerkin, for the weapon glanced aside,
      without doing him any injury. As Cholmondeley was about to repeat the
      thrust, and in a part less defended, he was himself pushed aside by
      Renard, who, by this time, had gained his feet, and was threatening
      vengeance upon his intended assassin. But the esquire was unwilling to
      abandon his prey; and in the struggle, Nightgall, exerting all his
      strength, broke from them, and wresting the dagger from Cholmondeley,
      succeeded in opening the door. Renard, foaming with rage, rushed after
      him, utterly forgetful of Cholmondeley, who listened with breathless
      anxiety, to their retreating footsteps. Scarcely knowing what to do, but
      resolved not to throw away the chance of escape, the esquire hastily
      attired himself, and taking up a lamp which Renard had left upon the
      floor, quitted the cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will seek out Cicely," he cried, "and set her free; and then, perhaps,
      we may be able to escape together."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hope that for a moment arose within his breast was checked by the
      danger and difficulty of making the search. Determined, however to hazard
      the attempt, he set out in a contrary direction to that taken by Nightgall
      and Renard, and proceeding at a rapid pace soon reached a flight of steps,
      up which he mounted. He was now within a second passage, similar to the
      first, with cells on either side; but though he was too well convinced,
      from the sounds issuing from them, that they were occupied, he did not
      dare to open any of them. Still pursuing his headlong course, he now took
      one turn&mdash;now another, until he was completely bewildered and
      exhausted. While leaning against the wall to recruit himself, he was
      startled by a light approaching at a distance and, fearing to encounter
      the person who bore it, was about to hurry away, when, to his
      inexpressible joy, he perceived it was Cicely. With a wild cry, he started
      towards her, calling to her by name; but the young damsel, mistaking him
      probably for her persecutor, let fall her lamp, uttered a piercing scream,
      and fled. In vain, her lover strove to overtake her&mdash;in vain, he
      shouted to her, and implored her to stop&mdash;his cries were drowned in
      her shrieks, and only added to her terror. Cholmondeley, however, though
      distanced, kept her for some time in view; when all at once she
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On gaining the spot where she had vanished, he found an open trap-door,
      and, certain she must have descended by it, took the same course. He found
      himself in a narrow, vaulted passage, but could discover no traces of her
      he sought. Hurrying forward, though almost ready to drop with fatigue, he
      came to a large octagonal chamber. At one side, he perceived a ladder, and
      at the head of it the arched entrance to a cell. In an agony of hope and
      fear he hastened towards the recess, and as he approached, his doubt was
      made certainty by a loud scream. Quick as thought, he sprang into the
      cell, and found, crouched in the further corner, the object of his search.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cicely," he exclaimed. "It is I&mdash;your lover&mdash;Cholmondeley."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!" she exclaimed, starting up, and gazing at him as if she could
      scarcely trust the evidence of her senses; "and I have been flying from
      you all this time, taking you for Nightgall." And throwing herself into
      his arms, she was strained passionately to his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first rapturous emotions had subsided, Cicely hastily explained
      to her lover that after she had been borne away by Nightgall she had
      fainted, and on reviving, found herself in her accustomed prison. Filled
      with alarm by his dreadful threats, she had determined to put an end to
      her existence rather than expose herself to his violence; and had arisen
      with that resolution, when an impulse prompted her to try the door. To her
      surprise it was unfastened&mdash;the bolt having shot wide of the socket,
      and quitting the cell, she had wandered about along the passages, until
      they had so mysteriously encountered each other. This explanation given,
      and Cholmondeley having related what had befallen him, the youthful pair,
      almost blinded to their perilous situation by their joy at their
      unexpected reunion, set forth in the hope of discovering the subterranean
      passage to the further side of the moat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too much engrossed by each other to heed whither they were going, they
      wandered on;&mdash;Cicely detailing all the persecution she had
      experienced from Nightgall, and her lover breathing vengeance against him.
      The only person she had seen, she said, during her captivity was Xit. He
      had found his way to her dungeon, but was discovered while endeavouring to
      liberate her by Nightgall, who threatened to put him to death, if he did
      not take a solemn oath, which he proposed, not to reveal to the place of
      her captivity. And she concluded the dwarf had kept his vow, as she had
      seen nothing of him since; nor had any one been led to her retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these details, as well as to her professions of love for him, unshaken
      by time or circumstance, Cholmondeley listened with such absorbing
      attention, that, lost to everything else, he tracked passage after
      passage, unconscious where he was going. At last, he opened a door which
      admitted them to a gloomy hall, terminated by a broad flight of steps,
      down which several armed figures wore descending. Cholmondeley would have
      retreated, but it was impossible. He had been perceived by the soldiers,
      who rushed towards him, questioned him and Cicely, and not being satisfied
      with their answers, conveyed them up the stairs to the lower guard-room in
      the White Tower, which it appeared the wanderers had approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, amongst other soldiers and warders, were the three giants, and
      instantly addressing them, Cholmondeley delivered Cicely to their care. He
      would have had them convey her to the Stone Kitchen, but this an officer
      who was present would not permit, till inquiries had been made, and,
      meanwhile, the esquire was placed in arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this, an extraordinary bustle was heard at the door, and
      four soldiers entered carrying the body of a man upon a shutter. They set
      it down in the midst of the room. Amongst those, who flocked round to gaze
      upon it, was Cholmondeley. It was a frightful spectacle. But in the
      mutilated, though still breathing mass, the esquire recognized Nightgall.
      While he was gazing at the miserable wretch, and marvelling how he came in
      this condition, a tall personage strode into the room, and commanding the
      group to stand aside, approached the body. It was Renard. After regarding
      the dying man for a few moments with savage satisfaction, he turned to
      depart, when his eye fell upon Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had forgotten you," he said. "But it seems you have not neglected the
      opportunity offered you of escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We caught him trying to get out of the subterranean passages, your
      excellency," remarked the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him remain here till further orders," rejoined Renard. "You have
      saved my life, and shall find I am not ungrateful," he added to
      Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your excellency would indeed requite me," replied the esquire, "you
      will give orders that this maiden, long and falsely, imprisoned by the
      wretch before us, may be allowed to return to her friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know her," rejoined Renard, looking at Cicely; "and I know that what
      you say is true. Release her," he added to the officer. And giving a last
      terrible look at Nightgall, he quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Cicely here? groaned the dying man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is," replied Cholmondeley. "Have you aught to say to her!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, and to you, too," replied Nightgall. "Let her approach, and bid the
      others stand off; and I will confess all I have done. Give me a draught of
      wine, for it is a long story, and I must have strength to tell it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before relating Nightgall's confession, it will be necessary to see what
      dreadful accident had befallen him; and in order to do this, his course
      must be traced, subsequently to his flight from Cholmondeley's dungeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acquainted with all the intricacies of the passages, and running with
      great speed, Nightgall soon distanced his pursuer, who having lost trace
      of him, was obliged to give up the chase. Determined, however, not to be
      baulked of his prey, he retraced his steps to the torture-chamber, where
      he found Wolfytt, Sorro-cold, and three other officials, to whom he
      recounted the jailor's atrocious attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will engage to find him for your excellency," said Wolfytt, who bore no
      very kindly feeling to Nightgall, "if he is anywhere below the Tower. I
      know every turn and hole in these passages better than the oldest rat that
      haunts them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deliver him to my vengeance," rejoined Renard, "and you shall hold his
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Says your excellency so!" cried Wolfytt; "then you may account him
      already in your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, he snatched up a halberd and a torch, and bidding two of the
      officials come with him, started off at a swift pace on the right. Neither
      he nor his companions relaxed their pace, but tracked passage after
      passage, and examined vault after vault&mdash;but still without success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Renard's impatience manifested itself in furious exclamations, and Wolfytt
      appeared perplexed and disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have it!" he exclaimed, rubbing his shaggy head. "He must have entered
      Saint John's Chapel, in the White Tower, by the secret passage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The party were again in motion; and, taking the least circuitous road,
      Wolfytt soon brought them to a narrow passage, at the end of which he
      descried a dark crouching figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have him!" he cried, exultingly. "There he is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping quickly along, for the roof was so low that he was compelled to
      stoop, Wolfytt prepared for an encounter with Nightgall. The latter
      grasped his dagger, and appeared ready to spring upon his assailant.
      Knowing the strength and ferocity of the jailor, Wolfytt hesitated a
      moment, but goaded on by Renard, who was close behind, and eager for
      vengeance, he was about to commence the attack, when Nightgall, taking
      advantage of the delay, touched a spring in the wall behind him, and a
      stone dropping from its place, he dashed through the aperture. With a yell
      of rage and disappointment, Wolfytt sprang after him, and was instantly
      struck down by a blow from his opponent's dagger. Renard followed, and
      beheld the fugitive speeding across the nave of Saint John's Chapel, and,
      without regarding Wolfytt, who was lying on the floor, bleeding profusely,
      he continued the pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall hurried up the steps behind the altar, and took his way along
      one of the arched stone galleries opening upon the council-chamber. But,
      swiftly as he fled, Renard, to whom fury had lent wings, rapidly gained
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more than an hour after day-break, but no one was astir in this
      part of the citadel, and as the pursued and pursuer threaded the gallery,
      and crossed the council-chamber, they did not meet even a solitary
      attendant. Nightgall was now within the southern gallery of the White
      Tower, and Renard shouted to him to stop; but he heeded not the cry. In
      another moment, he reached a door, opening upon the north-east turret. It
      was bolted, and the time lost in unfastening it, brought Renard close upon
      him. Nightgall would have descended, but thinking he heard voices below,
      he ran up the winding stairs.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Renard now felt secure of him, and uttered a shout of savage delight. The
      fugitive would have gained the roof, if he had not been intercepted by a
      party of men, who at the very moment he reached the doorway communicating
      with the leads presented themselves at it. Hearing the clamour raised by
      Renard and his followers below, these men commanded Nightgall to
      surrender. Instead of complying, the miserable fugitive, now at his wits'
      end, rushed backwards, with the determination of assailing Renard. He met
      the ambassador at a turn in the stairs a little below, and aimed a
      desperate blow at him with his dagger. But Renard easily warded it off,
      and pressing him backwards, drove him into one of the deep embrasures at
      the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven to desperation, Nightgall at first thought of springing through the
      loophole; but the involuntary glance that he cast below, made him recoil.
      On seeing his terror, Renard was filled with delight, and determined to
      prolong his enjoyment. In vain, Nightgall endeavoured to escape from the
      dreadful snare in which he was caught. He was driven remorselessly back.
      In vain, he implored mercy in the most abject terms. None was shown him.
      Getting within the embrasure, which was about twelve feet deep, Renard
      deliberately pricked the wretched man with the point of his sword, and
      forced him slowly backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nightgall struggled desperately against the horrible fate that awaited
      him, striking at Renard with his dagger, clutching convulsively against
      the wall, and disputing the ground inch by inch. But all was unavailing.
      Scarcely a foot's space intervened between him and destruction, when
      Renard sprang forward, and pushed him by main force through the loophole.
      He uttered a fearful cry, and tried to grasp at the roughened surface of
      the wall. Renard watched his descent. It was from a height of near ninety
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell with a terrific smash upon the pavement of the court below. Three
      or four halberdiers, who were passing at a little distance, hearing the
      noise, ran towards him, but finding he was not dead, though almost dashed
      in pieces, and scarcely retaining a vestige of humanity, they brought a
      shutter, and conveyed him to the lower guard-room, as already related.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no hope of mercy," gasped the dying man, as his request was
      complied with, and Cicely, with averted eyes, stood beside him, "and I
      deserve none. But I will make what atonement I can for my evil deeds.
      Listen to me, Cicely, (or rather I should say Angela, for that is your
      rightful name,) you are the daughter of Sir Alberic Mountjoy, and were
      born while your parents were imprisoned in the Tower. Your mother, the
      Lady Grace, lost her reason on the day of her husband's execution, as I
      have before stated. But she did not expire as I gave out. My motive for
      setting on foot this story, and for keeping her existence secret, was the
      hope of making her mine if she recovered her senses, as I had reason to
      believe would be the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretch!" exclaimed Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot upbraid me more than I now upbraid myself," groaned Nightgall;
      "but my purpose was thwarted. The ill-fated lady never recovered, and
      disappointment, acting upon my evil nature, made me treat her with such
      cruelty that her senses became more unsettled than ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! alas!" cried Cicely, bursting into tears; "my poor mother! what a
      fate was yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When all hope of her recovery was extinguished," continued Nightgall, "I
      thought, that if any change occurred in the sovereignty or religion of the
      country, I might, by producing her, and relating a feigned story, obtain a
      handsome reward for her preservation. But this expectation also passed by.
      And I must confess that, at length, my only motive for allowing her to
      exist was that she formed an object to exercise my cruelty upon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven's curse upon you!" cried Cholmondeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare your maledictions," rejoined Nightgall; "or heap them on my
      lifeless clay. You will soon be sufficiently avenged. Give me another
      draught of wine, for my lips are so dry I can scarcely speak, and I would
      not willingly expire till I have made known the sum of my wickedness."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wine given him, he proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not tell you all the devilish cruelties I practised upon the
      wretched Alexia, (for so, as you are aware, I called her, to conceal her
      real name,)&mdash;because from what you have seen you may guess the rest.
      But I kept her a solitary captive in those secret dungeons, for a term of
      nearly seventeen years&mdash;ever since your birth, in short," he added,
      to Cicely. "Sometimes, she would elude my vigilance, and run shrieking
      along the passages. But when any of the jailors beheld her, they fled,
      supposing her a supernatural being."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her shrieks were indeed dreadful," remarked Cholmondeley. "I shall never
      forget their effect upon me. But you allowed her to perish from famine at
      last?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her death was accidental," replied Nightgall, in a hollow voice, "though
      it lies as heavy on my soul as if I had designed it. I had shut her up for
      security in the cell in the Devilin Tower, where you found her, meaning to
      visit her at night, as was my custom, with provisions. But I was sent on
      special business by the queen to the palace at Greenwich for three days;
      and on my return to the Tower, I found the wretched captive dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She had escaped you, then," said Cholmondeley, bitterly. "But you have
      not spoken of her daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, let me tell you where I have hidden the body, that decent burial
      may be given it," groaned Nightgall. "It lies in the vault beneath the
      Devilin Tower&mdash;in the centre of the chamber&mdash;not deep&mdash;not
      deep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not forget," replied Cholmondeley, noticing with alarm that an
      awful change had taken place in his countenance. "What of her child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must be brief," replied Nightgall, faintly; "for I feel that my end
      approaches. The little Angela was conveyed by me, to Dame Potentia
      Trusbut. I said she was the offspring of a lady of rank,&mdash;but
      revealed no name,&mdash;and what I told beside was a mere fable. The good
      dame, having no child of her own, readily adopted her, and named her
      Cicely. She grew up in years&mdash;in beauty; and as I beheld her dawning
      charms, the love I had entertained for the mother was transferred to the
      child&mdash;nay, it was ten times stronger. I endeavoured to gain her
      affections, and fancied I should succeed, till you"&mdash;looking at
      Cholmondeley&mdash;"appeared. Then I saw my suit was hopeless. Then evil
      feelings again took possession of me, and I began a fresh career of crime.
      You know the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," replied Cholmondeley. "Have you aught further to disclose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only this," rejoined Nightgall, who was evidently on the verge of
      dissolution. "Cut open my doublet; and within its folds you will find
      proofs of Angela's birth, together with other papers referring to her
      ill-fated parents. Lay them before the queen; and I make no doubt that the
      estates of her father, who was a firm adherent to the Catholic faith, and
      died for it, as well as a stanch supporter of Queen Catherine of Arragon,
      will be restored to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholmondeley lost not a moment in obeying the injunction. He cut open the
      blood-stained jerkin of the dying man, and found, as he had stated, a
      packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is it," cried Nightgall, fixing his glazing eyes on Angela,&mdash;"that
      will restore you to your wealth&mdash;your title. The priest by whom you
      were baptised was the queen's confessor, Feckenham. He will remember the
      circumstance&mdash;he was the ghostly counsellor of both your parents.
      Take the packet to him and he will plead your cause with the queen. Forget&mdash;
      forgive me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      His utterance was suddenly choked by a stream of blood that gushed from
      his mouth, and with a hideous expression of pain he expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Horrible!" cried Angela, placing her hands before her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think not of him," said Cholmondeley, supporting her, and removing her to
      a little distance,&mdash;"think of the misery you have escaped,&mdash;of
      the rank to which you will assuredly be restored. When I first beheld
      those proud and beautiful lineaments, I was certain they belonged to one
      of high birth. And I was not mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What matters my newly-discovered birth&mdash;my title&mdash;my estates,
      if I obtain them,&mdash;if <i>you</i> are lost to me!" cried Angela,
      despairingly. "I shall never know happiness without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, an usher, who had entered the guard-room, marched up to
      Cholmondeley, and said, "I am the bearer of the queen's pardon to you.
      Your life is spared, at the instance of the Spanish ambassador. But you
      are to remain a prisoner on parole, within the fortress, during the royal
      pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is now my turn to support you," said Angela, observing her lover
      stagger, and turn deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So many events crowd upon my brain," cried Cholmondeley, "that I begin to
      fear for my reason&mdash;Air!&mdash;air!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Led into the open court, he speedily recovered, and in a transport of such
      joy as has seldom been experienced, he accompanied Angela to the Stone
      Kitchen, where they were greeted with mingled tears and rejoicings by Dame
      Potentia and her spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the day, Cholmondeloy sought out Feckenham, and laid the
      papers before him. The confessor confirmed all that Nightgall had stated
      respecting the baptism of the infant daughter of Lady Mountjoy, and the
      other documents satisfied him that the so-called Cicely was that daughter.
      He undertook to lay the case at once before the queen, and was as good as
      his word. Mary heard his statement with the deepest interest, but made no
      remark; and at its conclusion desired that the damsel might be brought
      before her.

      XXXVII.&mdash;-HOW JANE WAS IMPRISONED IN THE MARTIN TOWER; HOW SHE WAS

      THE TIME OF HER EXECUTION WAS FIXED; AND HOW SHE WAS RESPITED FOR THREE
      DAYS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Martin Tower
      (or, as it is now termed, the Jewel Tower, from the purpose to which it is
      appropriated), where Jane was confined by the queen's commands, lies at
      the north-eastern extremity of the ballium wall, and corresponds in size
      and structure with the Develin, or Devereux Tower, at the opposite angle.
      Circular in form, like the last-mentioned building, and erected, in all
      probability, at the same period&mdash;the latter end of the reign of John,
      or the commencement of that of Henry the Third, it consists of two stories
      having walls of immense thickness, and containing, as is the case with
      every other fortification, deep recesses, terminated by narrow loop-holes.
      A winding stone staircase, still in a tolerable state of preservation,
      communicates with these stories, and with the roof, which was formerly
      embattled, and defended on either side by two small square turrets.
      Externally, on the west, the Martin Tower has lost its original character;
      the walls being new-fronted and modernized, and a flight of stops raised
      to the upper story, completely masking the ancient door-way, which now
      forms the entrance to the jewel-room. On the cast, however, it retains
      much of its ancient appearance, though in part concealed by surrounding
      habitations; and when the building now in progress, and intended for the
      reception of the regalia, is completed, it will be still further hidden. *
      While digging the foundations of the proposed structure, which were sunk
      much below the level of the ballium wall, it became apparent that the
      ground had been artificially raised to a considerable height by an
      embankment of gravel and sand; and the prodigious solidity and strength of
      the wall were proved from the difficulty experienced by the workmen in
      breaking through it, to effect a communication with the new erection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, on the basement floor, on the left of the passage, and generally
      hidden by the massive portal, is a small cell constructed in the thickness
      of the wall; and further on, the gloomy chamber used as a depositary for
      the crown ornaments, and which requires to be artificially lighted, is
      noticeable for its architecture, having a vaulted and groined roof of
      great beauty. The upper story, part of the residence of Mr. Swift, the
      keeper of the regalia, at present comprehends two apartments, with a hall
      leading to them, while the ceiling having been lowered, other rooms are
      gained. Here, besides the ill-fated and illustrious lady whose history
      forms the subject of this chronicle, was confined the lovely, and, perhaps
      guiltless, Anne Boleyn. The latter fact has, however, been doubted, and
      the upper chamber in the Beauchamp Tower assigned as the place of her
      imprisonment. But this supposition, from many circumstances, appears
      improbable, and the inscription bearing her name, and carved near the
      entrance of the hall, is conclusive as to her having been confined in this
      tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, in 1641, the twelve bishops, impeached of high treason by the
      revolutionary party in the House of Commons, for protesting against the
      force used against them, and the acts done in their absence, were
      imprisoned during their committal to the Tower:&mdash;at least, so runs
      the legend, though it is difficult to conceive how so many persons could
      be accommodated in so small a place. Here, also, Blood made his atrocious
      attempt (a story still involved in obscurity&mdash;it has been
      conjectured, with some show of probability, that he was prompted to the
      deed by Charles himself), to steal the crown jewels; and in this very
      chamber, the venerable Talbot Edwards made his gallant defence of the
      royal ensigns, receiving for his bravery and his wounds, a paltry grant of
      two hundred pounds, half of which, owing to vexatious delays, he only
      received, while the baffled robber was rewarded with a post at court, and
      a pension of five hundred pounds a-year in Ireland. Can it be doubted
      after this which of the two was the offender, in the eyes of the monarch?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The view of this fabric, at page 321, was taken from the
     spot cleared out for the erection of the New Jewel Rooms;
     and as the latter structure is already in a state of
     forwardness, and will be probably finished before Christmas,
     this aspect of the old tower can scarcely be said to exist
     longer.

      It must not be omitted that the Jewel Tower enjoys, in common with its
      corresponding fortification, the Devereux Tower, the reputation of being
      haunted. Its ghostly visitant is a female figure robed in white&mdash;whether
      the spirit of Anno Boleyn, or the ill-fated Jane, cannot be precisely
      ascertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Martin Tower acquired its present designation of the Jewel Tower, in
      the reign of James the First, when the crown ornaments were removed to it
      from a small building, where they had been hitherto kept, on the south
      side of the White Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regalia were first exhibited to the public in the reign of Charles the
      Second, when many of the perquisites of the ancient master of the Jewel
      House were abolished, and its privileges annexed to the office of the lord
      chamberlain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's present prison was far more commodious than her former place of
      confinement in the Brick Tower, and by Mary's express injunctions, every
      attention consistent with her situation was shown her. Strange as it may
      seem, she felt easier, if not happier, than she had done during the latter
      part of the period of her liberation. Then, she was dissatisfied with
      herself, anxious for her husband, certain of the failure of his
      enterprise, and almost desiring its failure,&mdash;now, the worst was
      past. No longer agitated by the affairs of the world, she could suffer
      with patience, and devote herself wholly to God. Alone within her
      prison-chamber, she prayed with more fervour than she had been able to do
      for months; and the soothing effect it produced, was such, that she felt
      almost grateful for her chastening. "I am better able to bear misfortune
      than prosperity," she murmured, "and I cannot be too thankful to Heaven,
      that I am placed in a situation to call forth my strength. Oh! that Dudley
      may be able to endure his trial with equal fortitude! But I fear his proud
      heart will rebel. Sustain him, Lord! I beseech thee, and bring him to a
      true sense of his condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      Convinced that her days were now numbered, having no hope of pardon,
      scarcely desiring it, and determined to reject it, if coupled with any
      conditions affecting her faith, Jane made every preparation for her end.
      No longer giving up a portion of her time to study, she entirely occupied
      herself with her devotions. Influenced by the controversial spirit of the
      times, she had before been as anxious to overcome her opponents in
      argument, as they were to convince her of her errors. Now, though feeling
      equally strong in her cause, she was more lowly-minded. Reproaching
      herself bitterly with her departure from her duty, she sought by incessant
      prayer, by nightly vigil, by earnest and heart-felt supplication to wipe
      out the offence. "I have not sinned in ignorance," she thought, "but with
      my eyes open, and therefore my fault is far greater than if no light had
      been vouchsafed me. By sincere contrition alone can I hope to work out my
      salvation; and if sorrow, remorse, and shame, combined with the most
      earnest desire of amendment, constitute repentance, I am truly contrite.
      But I feel my own unworthiness, and though I know the mercy of Heaven is
      infinite, yet I scarcely dare to hope for forgiveness for my trespasses. I
      have trusted too much to myself already&mdash;and find that I relied on a
      broken reed. I will now trust only to God."
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus she passed her time, in the strictest self-examination, fixing
      her thoughts above, and withdrawing them as much as possible from earth.
      The effect was speedily manifest in her altered looks and demeanour. When
      first brought to the Martin Tower, she was downcast and despairing. Ere
      three days had passed, she became calm, and almost cheerful, and her
      features resumed their wonted serene and seraphic expression. She could
      not, it is true, deaden the pangs that ever and anon shook her, when she
      thought of her husband and father. But she strove to console herself by
      the hope that they would be purified, like herself, by the trial to which
      they were subjected, and that their time of separation would be brief. To
      the duke she addressed that touching letter preserved among the few
      fragments of her writings, which after it had been submitted to Gardiner,
      was allowed to be delivered to him. It concluded with these words:&mdash;"And
      thus, good father, I have opened unto you the state wherein I presently
      stand,&mdash;my death at hand. Although to you it may seem woful, yet to
      me there is nothing that can be more welcome than to aspire from this Vale
      of Misery to that heavenly throne of all joy and pleasure with Christ, my
      Saviour. In whose steadfast faith (if it may be lawful for the daughter so
      to write to the father), the Lord who hath hitherto strengthened you so
      continue to keep you, that at the last we may meet in heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      With her husband she was allowed no communication; and in reply to her
      request to see him once more, she was told that their sole meeting would
      be on the scaffold:&mdash;a wanton insult, for it was not intended to
      execute them together. The room, or rooms, (for the large circular chamber
      was even then divided by a partition,) occupied by Jane in the Martin
      Tower, were those on the upper story, tenanted, as before-mentioned, by
      the keeper of the regalia, and her chief place of resort during the
      day-time was one of the deep embrasures looking towards the north. In this
      recess, wholly unobserved and undisturbed, she remained, while light
      lasted, upon her knees, with a book of prayers, or the bible before here,
      fearful of losing one of the precious moments which flew by so quickly&mdash;and
      now so tranquilly. At night, she withdrew, not to repose, but to a small
      table in the midst of the apartment, on which she placed the sacred volume
      and a lamp, and knelt down beside it. Had she not feared to disturb her
      calm condition, she would not have allowed herself more than an hour's
      repose, at the longest intervals nature could endure. But desirous of
      maintaining her composure to the last, she yielded to the demand, and from
      midnight to the third hour stretched herself upon her couch. She then
      arose, and resumed her devotions. The same rules were observed in respect
      to the food she permitted herself to take. Restricting herself to bread
      and water, she ate and drank sufficient to support nature, and no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth day after her confinement, the jailor informed her there was
      a person without who had an order from the queen to see her. Though Jane
      would have gladly refused admittance to the applicant, she answered
      meekly, "Let him come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately afterwards a grave-looking middle-aged man, with a studious
      countenance overclouded with sorrow, appeared, he was attired in a black
      robe, and carried a flat velvet cap in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Master Roger Ascham, my old instructor!" exclaimed Jane, rising as
      he approached, and extending her hand to him, "I am glad to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ascham was deeply affected. The tears rushed to his eyes, and it was some
      moments before he could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not lament for me, good friend," said Jane, in a cheerful tone, "but
      rejoice with me, that I have so profited by your instructions as to be
      able to bear my present lot with resignation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do indeed heartily rejoice at it, honoured and dear madam," replied
      Ascham, subduing his emotion, "and I would gladly persuade myself that my
      instructions had contributed in however slight a degree to your present
      composure. But you derive your fortitude from a higher source than any on
      earth. It is your piety, not your wisdom that sustains you; and though I
      have pointed out the way to the living waters at which you have drunk, it
      is to that fountain alone that you owe the inestimable blessing of your
      present frame of mind. I came not hither to depress, but to cheer you&mdash;not
      to instruct, but be instructed. Your life, madam, will afford the world
      one of the noblest lessons it has ever received, and though your career
      may be closed at the point whence most others start, it will have been run
      long enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! good Master Ascham," rejoined Jane, "I once thought that my life
      and its close would be profitable to our church&mdash;that my conduct
      might haply be a model to its disciples&mdash;and my name enrolled among
      its martyrs. Let him who standeth take heed lest he fall. I had too much
      confidence in myself. I yielded to impulses, which, though not culpable in
      the eyes of men, were so in those of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh madam! you reproach yourself far too severely," cried Ascham. "Unhappy
      circumstances have made you amenable to the laws of your country, it is
      true, and you give up your life as a willing sacrifice to justice. But
      this is all that can, or will be required of you, by your earthly or your
      supreme Judge. That your character might have been more absolutely
      faultless in the highest sense I will not deny, had you sacrificed every
      earthly feeling to duty. But I for one should not have admired&mdash;should
      not have loved you as I now love you, had you acted otherwise. What you
      consider a fault has proved you a true woman in heart and affection; and
      your constancy as a believer in the gospel, and upholder of its doctrines,
      has been equally strongly manifested. Your name in after ages will be a
      beacon and a guiding-star to the whole Protestant church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven grant it!" exclaimed Jane, fervently. "I once hoped&mdash;once
      thought so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope so&mdash;think so still," rejoined Ascham. "Ah, dear madam, when I
      last took my leave of you before my departure for Germany, and found you
      in your chamber at Bradgate, buried in the Phædo of the divine
      philosopher, while your noble father and his friends were hunting, and
      disporting themselves in the park&mdash;when to my wondering question, as
      to why you did not join in their pastime, you answered, 'that all their
      sport in the park was but a shadow to the pleasure you found in Plato'&mdash;adding,
      'alas! good folk, they never felt what true pleasure meant'&mdash;at that
      time, I little thought for what a sad, though proud destiny you were
      reserved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither did I, good Master Ascham," replied Jane; "but you now find me at
      a better study. I have exchanged him whom you term, and truly, in a
      certain sense, the 'divine' philosopher, for writings derived from the
      highest source of inspiration,&mdash;direct from heaven&mdash;and I find
      in this study more pleasure and far more profit than the other. And now
      farewell, good friend. Do me one last favour. Be present at my ending. And
      see how she, whom you have taught to live, will die. Heaven bless you!"
      &lt;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven bless you too, noble and dear lady," replied Ascham, kneeling and
      pressing her hand to his lips. "I will obey your wishes." He then arose,
      and covering his face to hide his fast-falling tears, withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane, also, was much moved, for she was greatly attached to her old
      instructor; and to subdue her emotion, took a few turns within her
      chamber. In doing this, she noticed the various inscriptions and devices
      carved by former occupants; and taking a pin, traced with its point the
      following lines, on the wall of the recess where she performed her
      devotions:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Non aliéna putes homini quæ obtingere possunt;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Sors hodierna mihi, eras erit ilia tibi.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Underneath, she added the following, and subscribed them with her name:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Deo juvante, nil nocet livor malus;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Et non juvante, nil juvat labor gravis:
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      Post tenebras, spero lucem!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lines have been effaced. But tradition has preserved them. How deeply
      affecting is the wish of the patient sufferer&mdash;"<i>Post tenebras,
      spero lucem!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had Jane resumed her devotions, when she was a second time
      interrupted by the jailor, who, ushering a young female into the room,
      departed. Jane arose, and fixed her eyes upon the new-comer, but did not
      appear to recognise her; while the latter, unable to restrain her tears,
      tottered towards her, and threw herself at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not know me, dearest madam?" she cried, in a voice suffocated by
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can it be Cicely?" inquired Jane, eagerly. "The tones are hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is&mdash;it is," sobbed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane instantly raised her, and pressed her affectionately to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" she exclaimed, gazing at her pale and emaciated features,
      now bedewed with tears, "you are as much altered as I am,&mdash;nay, more.
      You must have suffered greatly to rob you of your youth and beauty thus.
      But I should have known you at once, despite the change, had I not thought
      you dead. By what extraordinary chance do I behold you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she could command herself, Angela related all that had befallen
      her since their last sad parting. She told how she had been betrayed into
      the hands of Nightgall by one of his associates, who came to Sion House
      with a forged order for her arrest,&mdash;carried her off, and delivered
      her to the jailor. How she was conveyed by the subterranean passage from
      Tower Hill to the secret dungeons beneath the fortress,&mdash;how she was
      removed from one cell to another by her inexorable captor, and what she
      endured from his importunities, threats, and cruel treatment,&mdash;and
      how at last, when she had abandoned all hope of succour, Providence had
      unexpectedly and mysteriously interposed to release her, and punish her
      persecutor. She likewise recounted the extraordinary discovery of her
      birth&mdash;Nightgall's confession&mdash;Cholmondeley's interview with
      Feckenham&mdash;and concluded her narration thus:&mdash;"The confessor
      having informed me that her majesty desired I should be brought before
      her, I yesterday obeyed the mandate. She received me most graciously&mdash;ordered
      me to relate my story&mdash;listened to it with profound attention&mdash;and
      expressed great sympathy with my misfortunes. 'Your sufferings are at an
      end, I trust,' she said, when I had finished, 'and brighter and happie
      days are in store for you. The title and estates of which you have been so
      long and so unjustly deprived, shall be restored to you. Were it for your
      happiness, I would place you near my person; but a life of retirement, if
      I guess your disposition rightly, will suit you best.' In this I entirely
      agreed, and thanking her majesty for her kindness, she replied:&mdash;'You
      owe me no thanks, Angela. The daughter of Sir Alberic Mountjoy&mdash;my
      mother's trusty friend&mdash;has the strongest claims upon my gratitude.
      Your lover has already received a pardon, and when these unhappy affairs
      are ended, he shall be at liberty to quit the Tower. May you be happy with
      him!'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I echo that wish with all my heart, dear Angela," cried Jane. "May heaven
      bless your union!&mdash;and it <i>will</i> bless it, I am assured, for you
      deserve happiness. Nor am I less rejoiced at your deliverance than at
      Cholmondeley's. I looked upon myself as in some degree the cause of his
      destruction, and unceasingly reproached myself with having allowed him to
      accompany me to the Tower. But now I find&mdash;as I have ever found in my
      severest afflictions,&mdash;that all was for the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! madam," returned Angela, "when I see you here, I can with
      difficulty respond to the sentiment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not question the purposes of the Unquestionable, Angela," replied
      Jane, severely. "I am chastened because I deserve it, and for my own good.
      The wind is tempered to the shorn lamb, and fortitude is given me to bear
      my afflictions. Nay, they are <i>not</i> afflictions. I would not exchange
      my lot&mdash;sad as it seems to you&mdash;for that of the happiest and the
      freest within the realm. When the bondage of earth is once broken,&mdash;when
      the flesh has no more power over the spirit&mdash;when the gates of heaven
      are open for admittance&mdash;can the world, or worldly joys, possess
      further charms? No. These prison walls are no restraint to me. My soul
      soars upwards, and holds communion with God and with his elect, among whom
      I hope to be numbered. The scaffold will have no terror for me. I shall
      mount it as the first step towards heaven; and shall hail the stroke of
      the axe as the signal to my spirit to wing its flight to the throne of
      everlasting joy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am rebuked, madam," returned Angela, with a look of admiration. "Oh!
      that I might ever hope to obtain such a frame of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may do so, dear Angela," replied Jane&mdash;"but your lot is cast
      differently from mine. What is required from me is not required from you.
      Such strong devotional feelings have been implanted in my breast, for a
      wise purpose, that they usurp the place of all other, and fit me for my
      high calling. The earnest and hearty believer in the gospel will gladly
      embrace death, even if accompanied by the severest tortures, at seasons
      perilous to his church, in the conviction that it will be profitable to
      it. Such have been the deaths of the martyrs of our religion&mdash;such
      shall be my death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" exclaimed Angela, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must we part now?" inquired Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unless you desire it," replied Angela. "I have obtained the queen's
      permission to remain with you to the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank her for the boon," returned Jane. "It will be a great consolation
      to me to have you near me. Angela, you must not shrink from the last duty
      of a friend&mdash;you must accompany me to the scaffold. I may need you
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will shrink from nothing you injoin, madam," replied Angela,
      shuddering. "But I had rather&mdash;far rather&mdash;suffer in your
      stead."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane made no reply, but pressed her hand affectionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have omitted to tell you, madam," continued Angela, "that the queen,
      before I was dismissed from the presence, urged me to embrace the faith of
      Rome,&mdash;that of my father, who perished for his adherence to it,&mdash;and
      to use my endeavours to induce you to become reconciled with that church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what answer did you make?" demanded Jane, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such as you yourself, would have made, madam," replied Angela&mdash;"I
      refused both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," rejoined Jane. "And now I must return to my devotions. You
      will have a weary office in attending me, Angela. Nor shall I be able to
      address more than a few words to you&mdash;and those but seldom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think not of me, madam," replied the other; "all I desire is to be near
      you, and to join my prayers with yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both then knelt down, and both prayed long and fervently. It would have
      been a touching sight to see those young and beautiful creatures with eyes
      upturned to heaven&mdash;hands clasped&mdash;and lips murmuring prayer.
      But the zeal that animated Jane far surpassed that of her companion. Long
      before the former sought her couch, fatigue overcame the latter, and she
      was compelled to retire to rest; and when she arose (though it was not yet
      daybreak), she found the unwearying devotee had already been up for hours.
      And so some days were spent&mdash;Jane ever praying&mdash;Angela praying
      too, but more frequently engaged in watching her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of Thursday, the 8th of February, the jailor appeared, with
      a countenance of unusual gloom, and informed his captive that the
      lieutenant of the Tower and Father Feckenham were without, and desired to
      see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admit them," replied Jane. "I know their errand. You are right welcome,
      sirs," she added, with a cheerful look, as they entered. "You bring me
      good news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! madam," replied Feckenham, sorrowfully, "we are the bearers of ill
      tidings. It is our melancholy office to acquaint you that your execution
      is appointed for to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why that <i>is</i> good news," returned Jane, with an unaltered
      countenance. "I have long and anxiously expected my release, and am glad
      to find it so near at hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am further charged, by the queen's highness, who desires not to kill
      the soul as well as the body," pursued Feckenham, "to entreat you to use
      the few hours remaining to you in making your peace with heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will strive to do so, sir,1' replied Jane meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not mistake me, madam," rejoined Feckenham, earnestly. "Her majesty's
      hope is that you will reconcile yourself with the holy Catholic church, by
      which means you can alone ensure your salvation. For this end, she has
      desired me to continue near you to the last, and to use my best efforts
      for your conversion&mdash;and by God's grace I will do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may spare yourself the labour, sir," replied Jane. "You will more
      easily overturn these solid walls by your arguments than my resolution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, suffer me to make the attempt," replied Feckenham. "That I have
      hitherto failed in convincing you is true, and I may fail now, but my very
      zeal must satisfy you that I have your welfare at heart, and am eager to
      deliver you from the bondage of Satan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never doubted your zeal, sir," returned Jane; "nor&mdash;and I say
      it in all humility,&mdash;do I doubt my own power to refute your
      arguments. But I must decline the contest now, because my time is short,
      and I would devote every moment to the service of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That excuse shall not avail you, madam," rejoined Fecken-ham,
      significantly. "The queen and the chancellor are as anxious as I am, for
      your conversion, and nothing shall be left undone to accomplish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must submit, then," replied Jane, with a look of resignation. "But I
      repeat, you will lose your labour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time will show," returned Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not yet dared to ask a question which has risen to my lips, but
      found no utterance," said Jane, in an altered tone. "Mv husband!&mdash;what
      of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His execution will take place at the same time with your own," replied
      Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall see him to-morrow, then?" cried Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps before," returned Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It were better not," said Jane, trembling. "I know not whether I can
      support the interview."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was right," muttered Feckenham to himself. "The way to move her is
      through the affections." And he made a sign to the lieutenant, who quitted
      the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prepare yourself, madam," he added to Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For your husband's approach. He is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the door was opened, and Dudley rushed forward, and caught
      her in his arms. Not a word was uttered for some moments by the afflicted
      pair. Angela withdrew weeping as if her heart would break, into one of the
      recesses, and Feckenham and the lieutenant into another. After the lapse
      of a short time, thinking it a favourable opportunity for his purpose, the
      confessor came forward. Jane and her husband were still locked in each
      other's embrace, and it seemed as if nothing but force could tear them
      asunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not disturb you," said Feckenham, "but my orders are that this
      interview must be brief. I am empowered also to state, madam," he added to
      Jane, "that her majesty will even now pardon your husband, notwithstanding
      his heinous offences against her, provided you are publicly reconciled
      with the church of Rome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot do it, Dudley," cried Jane, in a voice of agony&mdash;"I cannot&mdash;cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither do I desire it," he replied. "I would not purchase life on such
      terms. We will die together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," observed Feckenham, with a disconcerted look. "The offer will
      never be repeated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would never have been made at all, if there had been a chance of its
      acceptance," returned Dudley, coldly. "Tell your royal mistress, that I
      love my wife too well to require such a sacrifice at her hands, and that
      she loves me too well to make it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dudley," exclaimed Jane, gazing at him with tearful eyes, "I can now die
      without a pang."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you aught more to say to each other?" demanded Feckenham. "You will
      meet no more on earth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, on the scaffold," cried Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," replied Feckcnham, gloomily. "Lord Guilford Dudley will suffer
      on Tower Hill&mdash;you, madam, will meet your sentence on the green
      before the White Tower, where Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard perished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall meet in the grave, then," rejoined Dudley, bitterly, "where
      Mary's tyranny can neither reach us, nor the voice of juggling priest
      disturb us more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your prisoner," cried Feckenham, turning angrily to the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, dear Dudley," exclaimed Jane, straining him to her bosom&mdash;"Be
      constant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As yourself," he replied, gently disengaging himself from her. "I am
      ready, sir," he added, to Brydges. And without hazarding another look at
      Jane, who fell back in the arms of Angela, he quitted the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour after this, when Jane had in some degree recovered from the
      shock, Feckenham returned, and informed her that he had obtained from the
      queen a reprieve for herself and her husband for three days. "You can now
      no longer allege the shortness of the time allowed you, as a reason for
      declining a conference with me," he said: "and I pray you address yourself
      earnestly to the subject, for I will not desist till I have convinced and
      converted you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I shall have little of the time allotted me to myself," replied
      Jane. "But I will not repine. My troubles may benefit others&mdash;if not
      myself."

    <h2>
      XXXVIII.&mdash;HOW THE PRINCESS ELIZABETH AND COURTENAY WERE DELIVERED OUT
      OF THE TOWER TO FURTHER DURANCE; AND HOW QUEEN MARY WAS WEDDED, BY PROXY,
      TO PHILIP OF SPAIN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>lizabeth still
      continued a close prisoner in the Bell Tower. But she indulged the most
      sanguine expectations of a speedy release. Her affections had received a
      severe blow in Courtenay's relinquishment of his pretensions to her hand,
      and it required all her pride and mastery over herself to bear up against
      it. She did, however, succeed in conquering her feelings, and with her
      usual impetuosity, began now to hate him in the proportion of her former
      love. While his mistress was thus brooding over the past, and trying to
      regulate her conduct for the future within the narrow walls of her prison,
      Courtenay, who had been removed to the Flint Tower, where he was confined
      in the basement chamber, was likewise occupied in revolving his brief and
      troubled career. A captive from his youth, he had enjoyed a few months'
      liberty, during which, visions of glory, power, greatness, and love&mdash;such
      as have seldom visited the most exalted&mdash;opened upon him. The bright
      dream was now ended, and he was once more a captive. Slight as his
      experience had been, he was sickened of the intrigues and hollowness of
      court life, and sighed for freedom and retirement. Elizabeth still
      retained absolute possession of his heart, but he feared to espouse her,
      because he was firmly persuaded that her haughty and ambitious character
      would involve him in perpetual troubles. Cost what it might, he determined
      to resign her hand as his sole hope of future tranquillity. In this
      resolution he was confirmed by Gardiner, who visited him in secret, and
      counselled him as to the best course to pursue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you claim my promise," observed the crafty chancellor, "I will fulfil
      it, and procure you the hand of the princess, but I warn you you will not
      hold it long. Another rebellion will follow, in which you and Elizabeth
      will infallibly be mixed up, and then nothing will save you from the
      block."
    </p>
    <p>
      Courtenay acquiesced, and Gardiner having gained his point, left him with
      the warmest assurances that he would watch over his safety. Insincere as
      he was, the Chancellor was well-disposed towards Courtenay, but he had a
      difficult game to play. He was met on all hands by Renard, who was bent on
      the Earl's destruction and that of the princess; and every move he made
      with the queen was checked by his wary and subtle antagonist.
      Notwithstanding her belief in their treasonable practices, Mary was
      inclined to pardon the offenders, but Renard entreated her to suspend her
      judgment upon them, till the emperor's opinion could be ascertained. This,
      he well knew, if agreed to, would insure their ruin, as he had written
      secretly in such terms to Charles the Fifth as he was satisfied would
      accomplish his object. Extraordinary despatch was used by the messengers;
      and to Renard's infinite delight, while he and Gardiner were struggling
      for ascendancy over the queen, a courier arrived from Madrid. Renard's joy
      was converted into positive triumph as he opened his own letters received
      by the same hand, and found that the emperor acquiesced in the expediency
      of the severest measures towards Elizabeth and her suitor, and recommended
      their immediate execution. The same despatches informed him that Charles,
      apprehensive of some further difficulty in respect to his son's projected
      union with Mary, had written to the Count D'Egmont at Brussels, with
      letters of ratification and procuration, commissioning him to repair to
      the court of London without delay, and conclude the engagement by
      espousing the queen by proxy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not many hours later, the Count himself, who had set out instantly from
      Brussels on receiving his commission, arrived. He was received on the
      queen's part by the Earl of Pembroke, the Earl of Shrewsbury, comptroller
      of the household, and the Marquis of Winchester, high treasurer, and
      conducted to the state apartments within the palace of the Tower, where
      the court was then staying. Mary appointed an audience with him on the
      following day, and in the interim, to Renard's disappointment, remained
      closeted with Gardiner, and would see no one beside. The ambassador,
      however, consoled himself with the certainty of success, and passed the
      evening in consultation with D'Egmont, to whom he detailed all that had
      passed since the flight of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heretical faction in England," he observed, "is entirely crushed&mdash;or
      will be so, when Jane and Elizabeth are executed. And if his highness,
      Prince Philip, will follow up my measures, he may not only restore the old
      faith throughout the realm, but establish the inquisition in the heart of
      London within six months."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, at the appointed hour, the Count D'Egmont attended by Renard
      and the whole of his suite, was conducted with much ceremony to the
      council-chamber in the White Tower. He found Mary surrounded by the whole
      of her ministers, and prostrating himself before the throne, acquainted
      her with his mission, and, presenting her with the letters of procuration
      he had received from the prince, entreated her to ratify on her side the
      articles already agreed upon. To this request, for which she was already
      prepared by the emperor's despatches, Mary vouchsafed a gracious answer,
      saying: "I am as impatient for the completion of the contract as the
      prince your master can be, and shall not hesitate a moment to comply with
      his wishes. But I would," she added, smiling, "that he had come to claim
      its fulfilment himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His highness only awaits your majesty's summons, and an assurance that he
      can land upon your shores without occasioning further tumult," rejoined
      D'Egmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shall speedily receive that assurance," returned Mary. "Heaven be
      praised! our troubles are ended, and the spirit of disaffection and
      sedition checked, if not altogether extinguished. But I pray you hold me
      excused for a short time," she continued, motioning him to rise; "I have
      some needful business to conclude before I proceed with this solemnity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Waving her hand to Sir Thomas Brydges, who stood among the group of nobles
      near the throne, he immediately quitted the presence, returning in a few
      moments with a guard of halberdiers in the midst of which were Elizabeth
      and Courtenay. At the approach of the prisoners, the assemblage divided
      into two lines to allow them passage; and preceded by the lieutenant, they
      advanced to within a short distance of the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marv, meantime, had seated herself; and her countenance, hitherto radiant
      with smiles, assumed a severe expression. A mournful silence pervaded the
      courtly throng, and all seemed as ominous and lowering as if a
      thunder-cloud had settled over them. This was not however the case with
      Renard. A sinister smile lighted up his features, and he observed in an
      under-tone to D'Egmont, "My hour of triumph is at hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait awhile," replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth looked in no wise abashed or dismayed by the position in which
      she found herself. Throwing angry and imperious glances around, and
      bending her brows on those who scanned her too curiously, she turned her
      back upon Courtenay, and seemed utterly unconscious of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the queen's command, Gardiner stepped forward, and taking a roll of
      paper from an attendant, proceeded to read the charges against the
      prisoners, together with the depositions of those who had been examined,
      as to their share in the insurrection. When he concluded, Elizabeth
      observed in a haughty tone&mdash;"There is nothing in all that to touch
      me, my lord. Wyat has recanted his confession, and avowed he was suborned
      by Renard. And as to the rest of my accusers, they are unworthy of credit.
      The queen's highness must acquit me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What say you, my lord!" demanded Gardiner of Courtenay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing," replied the earl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you confess yourself guilty of the high crimes and misdemeanours laid
      to your charge, then?" pursued the chancellor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" answered Courtenay, firmly. "But I will not seek to defend myself
      further. I throw myself on the queen's mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do wisely, my lord," returned Gardiner; "and your grace," he added to
      Elizabeth, "would do well to abate your pride, and imitate his example."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my father's time, my lord," observed the princess, scornfully, "you
      would not, for your head, have dared to hold such language towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dared to plead your mother's cause with him," retorted Gardiner with
      much asperity. "Your majesty will now pronounce such sentence upon the
      accused, as may seem meet to you," he added, turning to the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hold their guilt not clearly proven," replied Mary. "Nevertheless, too
      many suspicious circumstances appear against them to allow us to set them
      at large till all chance of further trouble is ended. Not desiring to deal
      harshly with them, we shall not confine them longer within the Tower.
      Which of you, my lords, will take charge of the princess Elizabeth? It
      will be no slight responsibility. You will answer for her security with
      your heads. Which of you will take charge of her, I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, she glanced inquiringly round the assemblage, but no answer
      was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had not your highness better send her grace under a sure guard to the
      emperor's court at Brussels," observed Renard, who could scarcely conceal
      his mortification at the queen's decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will think of it," returned Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sooner than this shall be," interposed Sir Henry Bedingfeld, "since none
      worthier of the office can be found, I will undertake it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are my good genius, Bedingfeld," replied Mary.&mdash;"To you, then, I
      confide her, and I will associate with you in the office, Sir John
      Williams, of Thame. The place of her confinement shall be my palace at
      Woodstock, and she will remain there till you receive further orders. You
      will set out with a sufficient guard for Oxfordshire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ever ready to obey your highness," replied Bedingfeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accursed meddler!" exclaimed Renard to D'Egmont, "he has marred my
      project."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Earl of Devonshire will be confined in Fotheringay Castle, in
      Northamptonshire," pursued Mary. "To you, Sir Thomas Tresham," she
      continued, addressing one of those near her, "I commit him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am honoured in the charge," returned Tresham, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will repent this ill-judged clemency," cried Renard, unable
      to repress his choler; "and since my counsels are unheeded, I must pray
      your highness to allow me to resign the post I hold near your person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," replied Mary in a freezing tone; "we accept your resignation&mdash;and
      shall pray his imperial majesty to recal you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this my reward?" exclaimed Renard, as he retired, covered with shame
      and confusion. "Cursed is he that puts faith in princes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners were then removed, and as they walked side by side,
      Courtenay sought to address the princess, but she turned away her head
      sharply, according him neither look nor word in reply. Finding himself
      thus repulsed, the earl desisted, and they proceeded in silence as long as
      their way lay together.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, without one farewell, they parted&mdash;to meet no more.
      Liberated at the instance of Philip of Spain, Courtenay journeyed to
      Italy, where he died two years afterwards, at Padua, obtaining, as
      Holinshed touchingly remarks, "that quiet, which in his life he could
      never have." Of the glorious destiny reserved for Elizabeth, nothing need
      be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prisoners removed, the queen presented her hand to the Earl of
      Pembroke, and repaired with her whole retinue to Saint John's Chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived there, Mary stationed herself at the altar, around which were
      grouped Bonner, Tunstal, Feckenham, and a host of other priests and
      choristers, in their full robes. In a short time, the nave and aisles of
      the sacred structure were densely crowded by the lords of the council,
      together with other nobles and their attendants, the dames of honour, the
      guard, and the suite of the Count D'Egmont. Nor were the galleries above
      unoccupied, every available situation finding a tenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Egmont, as the representative of Philip of Spain, took up a position on
      the right of the queen, and sustained his part with great dignity. As soon
      as Gardiner was prepared, the ceremonial commenced. D'Egmont tendered his
      hand to Mary, who took it, and they both knelt down upon the cushion
      before the altar, while the customary oaths were administered, and a
      solemn benediction pronounced over them. This done, they arose, and
      Gardiner observed to the queen in a voice audible throughout the structure&mdash;"Your
      majesty is now wedded to the Prince of Spain. May God preserve you both,
      and bless your union!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God preserve Queen Mary!" cried the Earl of Pembroke, stepping forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the shout was enthusiastically echoed by all within the chapel. But
      not a voice was raised, nor a blessing invoked for her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Te Deum</i> was then sung by the choristers, and mass performed by
      Bonner and the priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His imperial majesty entreats your acceptance of this slight offering,"
      said D'Egmont, when the sacred rites were concluded, presenting the queen
      with a diamond ring, of inestimable value.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept the gift," replied Mary, "and I beg you to offer my best thanks
      to the emperor. For yourself, I hope you will wear this ornament in
      remembrance of me, and of the occasion." And detaching a collar of gold
      set with precious stones from her own neck, she placed it over that of
      D'Egmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I now go to bring your husband, gracious madam," said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven grant you a safe and speedy journey!" replied Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to your highness a prosperous union!" rejoined the count; "and may
      your race long occupy the throne." So saying, he bowed and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Egmont's wish did not produce a cheering effect on Mary. Jane's words
      rushed to her mind, and she feared that her union would not be happy&mdash;would
      not be blessed with offspring. And it need scarcely be added, her
      forebodings were realised. Coldly treated by a haughty and neglectful
      husband, she went childless to the tomb.

      XXXIX.&mdash;OF THE WEDDING OF SIR NARCISSUS LE GRAND WITH JANE THE FOOL,
      AND WHAT HAPPENED AT IT; AND OF THE ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY HIM, ON THE
      OCCASION, TO HIS OLD FRIENDS AT THE STONE KITCHEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ir Narcissus Le
      Grand made rapid strides in the royal favour, as well as in that of his
      mistress. He was now in constant attendance on the queen, and his
      coxcombry afforded her so much amusement, that she gave him a post near
      her person, in order to enjoy it. Jane the Fool, too, who had a secret
      liking for him, though she affected displeasure at Mary's command, became
      so violently enamoured, and so excessively jealous, if the slightest
      attentions were paid him by the dames of honour, that the queen thought it
      desirable to fix an early day for wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happy event took place on Saturday, the 10th of February, at Saint
      Peter's chapel on the green, and was honoured by the presence of the
      queen, and all her attendants. Never were merrier nuptials witnessed! And
      even the grave countenance of Feckenham, the officiating priest on the
      occasion, wore a smile, as the bridegroom, attired in his gayest
      habiliments, bedecked at all points with lace, tags, and fringe; curled,
      scented, and glistening with silver and gold, was borne into the chapel on
      the shoulders of Og,&mdash;who had carried him from the By-ward Tower,
      through a vast concourse of spectators,&mdash;and deposited at the altar
      near the bride. Behind Og, came his two brethren, together with Dames
      Placida and Potentia; while Peter Trusbut, Ribald, and Winwike, brought up
      the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the height of his ambition, graced with a title, favoured by
      the queen, and idolised by his bride, who was not altogether destitute of
      personal attractions, and was, at least, twice his own size, the poor
      dwarfs brain was almost turned, and he had some difficulty in maintaining
      the decorous and dignified deportment which he felt it necessary to
      maintain on the occasion. The ceremony was soon performed,&mdash;too soon
      for Sir Narcissus, who would willingly have prolonged it&mdash;The royal
      train departed,&mdash;not, however, before Mary had bestowed a well-filled
      purse of gold upon the bridegroom, and commanded him to bring his friends
      to the palace, where a supper would be provided for them. Sir Narcissus
      then offered his hand to his bride, and led her forth, followed by his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vast crowd had collected before the doors of the sacred edifice. But a
      passage having been kept clear by a band of halberdiers for the queen, the
      lines were unbroken when the wedding-party appeared. Loud acclamations
      welcomed Sir Narcissus, who paused for a moment beneath the porch, and
      taking off his well-plumed cap, bowed repeatedly to the assemblage.
      Reiterated shouts and plaudits succeeded, and the clamour was so great
      from those who could not obtain a glimpse of him, that the little knight
      entreated Og to take him once more upon his shoulder. The request was
      immediately complied with; and when he was seen in this exalted situation,
      a deafening shout rent the skies. The applauses, however, were shared by
      his consort, who placed on the shoulder of Gog, became equally
      conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, they were carried side by side along the green, and Sir
      Narcissus was so enchanted that he desired the bearers to proceed as
      slowly as possible. His enthusiasm became at length so great, that when
      several of those around him jestingly cried, "Largesse, largesse! Sir
      Narcissus," he opened the purse lately given him by the queen, and which
      hung at his girdle, and threw away the broad pieces in showers. "I will
      win more gold," he observed to Og, who remonstrated with him on his
      profusion; "but such a day as this does not occur twice in one's life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happiness and long life attend you and your lovely dame, Sir Narcissus!"
      cried a bystander.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is not a knight in the Tower to be compared with you, worshipful
      sir!" roared another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You deserve the queen's favour!" vociferated a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greater dignities are in store for you!" added a fourth.

      Never was new-made and new-married knight so enchanted. Acknowledging all
      the compliments and fine speeches with smirks, smiles, and bows, he threw
      away fresh showers of gold. After making the complete circuit of the
      fortress, he crossed the drawbridge, and proceeded to the wharf, where he
      was hailed by different boats on the river: everywhere, his reception was
      the same. On the return of the party, Hairun invited them all to the
      Lions' Tower, and ushering them to the gallery, brought out several of the
      wild animals, and went through his performances as if the queen herself
      had been present. In imitation of the sovereign, Sir Narcissus bestowed
      his last few coins, together with the purse containing them, upon the
      bearward. During the exhibition, the knight had entertained his consort
      with an account of his combat with old Max; and before quitting the
      menagerie he led her into the open space in front of the cages, that she
      might have a nearer view of the formidable animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will not be necessary to read you such a lesson, sweetheart, as my
      friend Magog read his dame," he observed. "But it is as well you should
      know that I have a resource in case of need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not require to be brought to obedience by a bear, chuck,"
      returned Lady Le Grand, with a languishing look. "Your slightest word is
      law to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So she says now," observed Dame Potentia, who happened to overhear the
      remark, to Dame Placida. "But let a week pass over their heads, and she
      will alter her tone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps so," sighed Placida. "But I have never had my own way since my
      encounter with old Max. Besides, these dwarfs are fiery fellows, and have
      twice the spirit of men of larger growth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There <i>is</i> something in that, it must be owned," rejoined Potentia,
      reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Max, by Sir Narcissus's command, was let out of his cage, and when within
      a few yards of them, sat on his hind-legs, and opened his enormous jaws.
      At this sight, Lady Le Grand screamed, and took refuge behind her husband,
      who, bidding her fear nothing, drew his sword, and put himself in a
      posture of defence. Suppressing a laugh, Hairun informed the knight that
      Max only begged for something to eat; and sundry biscuits and apples being
      given him, he was driven back to his cage without any misadventure. Hairun
      then led the party to his lodging, where a collation was spread out for
      them, of which they partook-At its conclusion, Peter Trusbut observed,
      that if Sir Narcissus-and Lady Le Grand would honour him with their
      company at the Stone Kitchen on the following night, he would use his best
      endeavours to prepare a supper worthy of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will give me infinite pleasure to sup with thee, worthy Peter,"
      replied the knight, with a patronising air; "but I must insist that the
      banquet be at my expense. Thou shalt cook it,&mdash;I will pay for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, worshipful sir," rejoined Trusbut. "But I can have what I
      please from the royal larder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better," returned Sir Narcissus. "But mine the entertainment
      shall be. And I here invite you all to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My best endeavours shall be used to content your worship," replied the
      pantler. "We have had some good suppers in the Stone Kitchen ere now, but
      this shall exceed them all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," replied the knight. "Hairun, you had better bring your
      monkey to divert us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right willingly, worshipful sir," replied the bearward; "and if you have
      a cast-off suit of clothes to spare, I will deck him in them for the
      occasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find my last suit at the By-ward Tower," replied Sir Narcissus.
      "Og will give them to you; and you may, if you choose, confer upon him the
      name I have cast off with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not fail to adopt your worship's suggestion," returned Hairun,
      smothering a laugh. "Henceforth, I shall call my ape Xit, and who knows
      whether in due season he may not attain the dignity of knighthood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Narcissus did not exactly relish this remark, which made many of the
      guests smile; but he thought it better not to notice it, and taking a
      courteous leave of the hospitable bearward, proceeded to the palace, where
      a lodging was now given him, and where he passed the remainder of the day
      with his friends in jollity and carousing. Nor was it until the clock had
      chimed midnight, that he was left alone with his spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      At what hour Sir Narcissus arose on the following morning does not appear.
      But at eight in the evening, attired as on the previous day, and
      accompanied by his dame in her wedding-dress, he repaired to the Stone
      Kitchen. He found the whole party assembled, including, besides those he
      had invited, Win-wike, and his son, a chubby youth of some ten years old,
      Mauger, Wolfytt, and Sorrocold. Sir Narcissus could have dispensed with
      the company of the three latter; but not desiring to quarrel with them, he
      put the best face he could upon the matter, and bade them heartily
      welcome. He found, too, that Hairun had literally obeyed his injunctions,
      and brought his monkey with him, dressed up in his old clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to present Xit, the ape, to your worship," said the bearward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is welcome," replied Sir Narcissus, laughing, to conceal his vexation
      at the absurd resemblance which the animal bore to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Narcissus was then conducted to a seat at the head of the table. On
      the right was placed his lady, on the left, Dame Placida; while the
      pantler, who, as usual, filled the office of carver, faced him. The giants
      were separated by the other guests, and Ribald sat between Dames Placida
      and Potentia, both of whom he contrived to keep in most excellent humour.
      Peter Trusbut did not assert too much when he declared that the
      entertainment should surpass all that had previously been given in the
      Stone Kitchen; and not to be behindhand, the giants exceeded all their
      former efforts in the eating line. They did not, it is true, trouble
      themselves much with the first course, which consisted of various kinds of
      pottage and fish; though Og spoke in terms of rapturous commendation of a
      sturgeon's jowl, and Magog consumed the best part of a pickled tunny-fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when these were removed, and the more substantial viands appeared,
      they set to work in earnest. Turning up their noses at the boiled capons,
      roasted bustards, stewed quails, and other light matters, they, by one
      consent, assailed a largo shield of brawn, and speedily demolished it.
      Their next incursion was upon a venison pasty&mdash;a soused pig followed,&mdash;and
      while Gog prepared himself for a copious draught of Rhenish by a dish of
      anchovies, Magog, who had just emptied a huge two-handed flagon of
      bragget, sharpened his appetite&mdash;the edge of which was a little taken
      off,&mdash;with a plate of pickled oysters. A fawn roasted, whole, with a
      pudding in its inside, now claimed their attention, and was pronounced
      delicious. Og, then, helped himself to a shoulder of mutton and olives;
      Gog to a couple of roasted ruffs; and Magog again revived his flagging
      powers with a dish of buttered crabs. At this juncture, the strong waters
      were introduced by the pantler, and proved highly acceptable to the
      labouring giants.
    </p>

    <p>
      Peter Trusbut performed wonders. In the old terms of his art, he leached
      the brawn, reared the goose, sauced the capon, spoiled the fowls, flushed
      the chickens, unlaced the rabbits, winged the quails, minced the plovers,
      thighed the pigeons, bordered the venison pasty, tranched the sturgeon,
      under-tranched the tunny-fish, tamed the crab, and barbed the lobster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triumphs of the repast now appeared. They were a baked swan, served in
      a coffin of rye-paste; a crane, likewise roasted whole; and a peacock,
      decorated with its tail. The first of these birds,&mdash;to use his own
      terms,&mdash;was reared by the pantler; the second displayed; and the last
      disfigured. And disfigured it was, in more ways than one; for, snatching
      the gaudy plumes from its tail, Sir Narcissus decorated his dame's cap
      with them. The discussion of these noble dishes fully occupied the giants,
      and when they had consumed a tolerable share of each, they declared they
      had done. Nor could they be tempted with the marrow toasts, the fritters,
      the puddings, the wafers, and other cates and sweetmeats that followed,&mdash;though
      they did not display the like objection to the brimming cups of hippocras,
      which wound up the repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person who appeared to want appetite for the feast, or who,
      perhaps, was too busy to eat, was Sir Narcissus. For the first time in his
      life, he played the part of host, and he acquitted himself to admiration.
      Ever and anon, rising in his chair, with a goblet of wine in his hand, he
      would pledge some guest, or call out to Peter Trusbut to fill some empty
      plate. He had a jest for every one;&mdash;abundance of well-turned
      compliments for the ladies; and the tenderest glances and whispers for his
      dame, who looked more lovesick and devoted than ever. By the time the
      cloth was removed, and the dishes replaced by flagons and pots of hydromel
      and wine, Sir Narcissus was in the height of his glory. The wine had got a
      little into his head, but not more than added to his exhilaration, and he
      listened with rapturous delight to the speech made by Og, who in good set
      terms proposed his health and that of his bride. The pledge was drunk with
      the utmost enthusiasm; and in the heat of his excitement, Sir Narcissus
      mounted on the table, and bowing all round, returned thanks in the
      choicest phrases he could summon. His speech received several
      interruptions from the applauses of his guests; and Hairun, who was bent
      upon mischief, thought this a favourable opportunity for practising it.
      During the banquet, he had kept the monkey in the back-ground, but he now
      placed him on the table behind Sir Narcissus, whose gestures and posture
      the animal began to mimic. Its grimaces were so absurd and extraordinary,
      that the company roared with laughter, to the infinite astonishment of the
      speaker, who at the moment wras indulging in a pathetic regret, at the
      necessity he should be under of quitting his old haunts in consequence of
      his new dignities and duties; but his surprise was changed to anger, as he
      felt his sword suddenly twitched from the sheath, and beheld the grinning
      countenance of the ape close behind him. Uttering an exclamation of fury,
      he turned with the intention of sacrificing the cause of his annoyance on
      the spot; but the animal wras too quick for him, and springing on his
      shoulders, plucked off his cap, and twisted its fingers in his well-curled
      hair, lugging him tremendously. Screaming with pain and rage, Sir
      Narcissus ran round the table upsetting all in his course, but unable to
      free himself from his tormentor, who keeping fast hold of his head,
      grinned and chattered as if in mockery of his vociferations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Le Grand had not noticed the monkey's first proceedings, her
      attention being diverted by Ribald, who pressed her, with many compliments
      upon her charms, to take a goblet of malmsey which he had poured out for
      her. But she no sooner perceived what was going forward, than she flew to
      the rescue, beat off the monkey, and hugging her little lord to her bosom,
      almost smothered him with kisses and caresses. Nor were Dames Placida and
      Potcntia less attentive to him. At first, they had treated the matter as a
      joke, but seeing the diminutive knight was really alarmed, they rubbed his
      head, patted him on the back, embraced him as tenderly as Lady Le Grand
      would permit, and loudly upbraided Hairun for his misconduct. Scarcely
      able to conceal his laughter, the offender pretended the utmost regret,
      and instantly sent off the monkey by one of the attendants to the Lions'
      Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before Sir Narcissus could be fully appeased; and it
      required all the blandishments of the dames, and the humblest apologies
      from Hairun, to prevent him from quitting the party in high dudgeon. At
      length, however, he was persuaded by Magog to wash down his resentment in
      a pottle of sack, brewed by the pantler&mdash;and the generous drink
      restored him to instant good-humour. Called upon by the company to
      conclude his speech, he once more ventured upon the table, and declaiming
      bitterly against the interruption he had experienced, finished his oration
      amid the loudest cheers. He then bowed round in his most graceful manner,
      and returned to his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has already been stated that Mauger, Sorrocold, and Wolfytt were among
      the guests. The latter had pretty nearly recovered from the wound
      inflicted by Nightgall, which proved, on examination, by no means
      dangerous; and, regardless of the consequences, he ate, drank, laughed,
      and shouted as lustily as the rest. The other two being of a more grave
      and saturnine character, seldom smiled at what was going forward; and
      though they did not neglect to fill their goblets, took no share in the
      general conversation, but sat apart in a corner near the chimney with
      Winwike, discussing the terrible scenes they had witnessed in their
      different capacities, with the true gusto of amateurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so Lady Jane Grey and her husband will positively be executed
      to-morrow?" observed Winwike. "There is no chance of further reprieve, I
      suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None whatever," replied Mauger. "Father Feckenham, I understand, offered
      her two days more, if she would prolong her disputation with him, but she
      refused. No&mdash;no. There will be no further respite. She will suffer on
      the Green&mdash;her husband on Tower Hill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I heard," replied Sorrocold&mdash;"Poor soul! she is very young&mdash;not
      seventeen, I am told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poll&mdash;poh!" cried Mauger, gruffly&mdash;"there's nothing in that.
      Life is as sweet at seventy as seventeen. However, I'll do my work as
      quickly as I can. If you wish to see a head cleanly taken off, get as near
      the scaffold as you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not fail to do so," returned Sorrocold. "I would not miss it for
      the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as the clock strikes twelve, and the Sabbath is ended," continued
      Mauger, "my assistants will begin to put up the scaffold. You know the
      spot before Saint Peter's chapel. They say the grass won't grow there. But
      that's an old woman's tale&mdash;he! he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old woman's tale, or not," rejoined Winwike, gravely&mdash;"it's true.
      I've often examined the spot, and never could find a blade of herbage
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," rejoined Mauger, "I won't dispute the point. Believe it, and
      welcome. I could tell other strange tales concerning that place. It's a
      great privilege to be beheaded there, and only granted to illustrious
      personages. The last two who fell there were Queen Catherine Howard, and
      her confidante, the Countess of Rochford. Lady Jane Grey would be beheaded
      on Tower Hill, with her husband, but they are afraid of the mob, who might
      compassionate the youthful pair, and occasion a riot. It's better to be on
      the safe side&mdash;he! he!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said you had some other strange talcs to tell concerning that place,"
      observed Sorrocold. "What are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't much like talking about them," rejoined Mauger, reluctantly, "but
      since I've dropped a hint on the subject, I may as well speak out. You
      must know, then, that the night before the execution of the old Countess
      of Salisbury, who would not lay her head upon the block, and whom I was
      obliged to chase round the scaffold and bring down how I could&mdash;the
      night before she fell,&mdash;and a bright moonlight night it was,&mdash;I
      was standing on the scaffold putting it in order for the morrow, when all
      at once there issued from the church porch a female figure, shrouded from
      head to foot in white."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" exclaimed Sorrocold, breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," returned the headsman, "though filled with alarm, I never took my
      eyes from it, but watched it glide slowly round the scaffold, and finally
      return to the porch, where it disappeared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you address it?" asked Winwike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I," replied Mauger. "My tongue clove to the roof of my mouth. I could
      not have spoken to save my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange!" exclaimed Sorrocold. "Did you ever see it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, on the night before Catherine Howard's execution," replied Mauger;
      "and I have no doubt it will appear to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" cried Sorrocold. "I will watch for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall visit the scaffold myself, an hour after midnight," returned
      Mauger&mdash;"you can accompany me if you think proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed!" exclaimed the chirurgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were here interrupted by a boisterous roar of merriment from the
      other guests. While their sombre talk was going on, Ribald, who had made
      considerable progress in the good graces of Lady Le Grand, had related a
      merry tale, and at its close, which was attended with shouts of laughter,
      Sir Narcissus ordered a fresh supply of wine, and the vast measures were
      promptly replenished by the pantier. Several pleasant hours were thus
      consumed, until at last Sir Narcissus arose, or rather attempted to rise,
      for his limbs refused their office, and his gaze was rather unsteady, and
      addressed his friends as follows:&mdash;"Farewell, my merry gossips," he
      hiccupped&mdash;"farewell! As I am now a married man, I must keep go-o-o-d
      hours." (At this moment the clock struck twelve). "I have already
      trespassed too much on Lady Le Grand's good nature. She is getting sleepy.
      So, to speak truth, am! I shall often visit you again&mdash;as often, at
      least, as my dignities and duties will permit. Do not stand in awe of my
      presence. I shall always unbend with you&mdash;always. The truly great are
      never proud&mdash;at least to their inferiors. With their superiors it is
      a different matter. This alone would convince you of my illustrious
      origin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," cried Gog, "no one would suspect you of being the son of a groom
      of the pantry, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one," repeated Xit, fiercely, and making an ineffectual attempt to
      draw his sword, "or if he <i>did</i> suspect it, he should never live to
      repeat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," replied Gog, meekly. "<i>I</i> don't suspect it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "None of us suspect it," laughed Og.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am qu-quito sa-sa-satisfied," replied Sir Narcissus. "More wine, old
      Trusbut. Fill the pots, pantler. I'll give you a r-r-r-rousing pledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so will I," cried his dame, who, like her lord, was a little the
      worse for the wine she had swallowed,&mdash;her goblet being kept
      constantly filled by the assiduous Ribald&mdash;"so will I, if you don't
      come home directly, you little sot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady Le Gr-r-and," cried Sir Narcissus, furiously, "I'll divorce you.&mdash;I'll
      behead you as Harry the Eighth did Anne Boleyn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, chuck, you won't," replied the lady. "You will think better of it
      to-morrow." So saying, she snatched him up in her arms, and despite his
      resistance carried him off to his lodging in the palace, long before
      reaching which, he had fallen asleep, and when he awoke next morning, he
      had but a very confused recollection of the events of the preceding night.
    </p>

      And here, as it will be necessary to take leave of our little friend, we
      will give a hasty glance at his subsequent history. Within a year of his
      union, a son was born to him, who speedily eclipsed his sire in stature,
      and in due season became a stalwart, well-proportioned man, six feet in
      height, and bearing a remarkable resemblance to Ribald. Sir Narcissus was
      exceedingly fond of him; and it was rather a droll sight to see them
      together. The dwarfish knight continued to rise in favour with the queen,
      and might have been constantly with the court had he pleased, but as he
      preferred, from old habits and associations, residing within the Tower, he
      was allowed apartments in the palace, of which he was termed, in derision,
      the grand seneschal. On Elizabeth's accession, he was not removed, but
      retained his post till the middle of the reign of James the First, when he
      died full of years and honours&mdash;active, vain, and consequential to
      the last, and from his puny stature, always looking young. He was interred
      in front of Saint Peter's chapel on the green, near his old friends the
      giants, who had preceded him some years to the land of shadows, and the
      stone that marks his grave may still be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the three gigantic warders, they retained their posts, and played
      their parts at many a feast and high solemnity during Elizabeth's golden
      rule, waxing in girth and bulk as they advanced in years, until they
      became somewhat gross and unwieldy. Og, who had been long threatened with
      apoplexy, his head being almost buried in his enormous shoulders, expired
      suddenly in his chair after a feast; and his two brethren took his loss so
      much to heart, that they abstained altogether from the flask, and followed
      him in less than six months, dying, it was thought, of grief, but more
      probably of dropsy. Their resting-place has been already indicated. In the
      same spot, also, the Lady Le Grand, Dame Placida, and the worthy pantler
      and his spouse. Magog was a widower during the latter part of his life,
      and exhibited no anxiety to enter a second time into the holy estate of
      matrimony. Og and Gog died unmarried.

    <h2>
      XL.&mdash;OF THE VISION SEEN BY MAUGER AND SORROCOLD ON THE TOWER GREEN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter the forcible
      abduction of Sir Narcissus by his spouse, the party broke up,&mdash;Og and
      Gog shaping their course to the By-ward Tower, Magog and his spouse,
      together with Ribald, who had taken up his quarters with them, to their
      lodging on the hill leading to the Green,&mdash;Hairun to the Lions'
      Tower, Win-wike and his son to the Flint Tower, while Mauger, Wolfytt, and
      Sorrocold proceeded to the Cradle Tower. Unfastening his door, the
      headsman struck a light, and setting fire to a lamp, motioned the others
      to a bench, and placed a stone jar of strong waters before them, of which
      Wolfytt took a long, deep pull, but the chirurgeon declined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have had enough," he said. "Besides, I want to see the spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care for no other spirit but this," rejoined Wolfytt, again applying
      his mouth to the jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care of yourselves, masters," observed Mauger. "I must attend to
      business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind us," laughed Wolfytt, observing the executioner take up an
      axe, and after examining its edge, begin to sharpen it, "grind away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is for Lord Guilford Dudley," remarked Mauger, as he turned the
      wheel with his foot. "I shall need two axes to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sharp work," observed Wolfytt, with a detestable grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would think so were I to try one on you," retorted Mauger. "Ay, now
      it will do," he added laying aside the implement, and taking up another.
      "This is my favourite axe. I can make sure work with it. I always keep it
      for queens or dames of high degree&mdash;he! he! This notch, which I can
      never grind away, was made by the old Countess of Salisbury, that I told
      you about. It was a terrible sight to see her white hair dabbled with
      blood. Poor Lady Jane won't give me so much trouble, I'll be sworn. She'll
      die like a lamb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay," muttered Sorrocold. "God send her a speedy death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's sure of it with me," returned Mauger, "so you may rest easy on that
      score." And as he turned the grindstone quickly round, drawing sparks from
      the steel, he chaunted; as hoarsely as a raven, the following ditty:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The axe was sharp, and heavy as lead,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As it touched the neck, off went the head!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      <i>Wh i r&mdash;wh i r&mdash;wh i r&mdash;wh i r!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And the screaming of the grindstone formed an appropriate accompaniment to
      the melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Queen Anne laid her white throat upon the block,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Quietly waiting the fatal shock;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The axe it severed it right in twain,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And so quick&mdash;so true&mdash;that she felt no pain!
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      Whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And he again set the wheel in motion.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Salisbury's countess, she would not die
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      As a proud dame should&mdash;decorously.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Lifting my axe, I split her skull,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And the edge since then has been notched and dull.
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      Whir&mdash;tvhir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Queen Catherine Howard gave me a fee,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A chain of gold&mdash;to die easily:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And her costly present she did not rue,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For I touched her head, and away it flew!
    </p>
    <p class="indent40">
      Whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir&mdash;whir!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "A brave song, and well sung," cried Wolfytt, approvingly. "Have you any
      more of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Mauger, significantly. "I shall make another verse
      to-morrow. My axe is now as sharp as a razor," he added, feeling its edge.
      "Suppose we go to the scaffold? It must be up by this time.",
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," replied Sorrocold, whose superstitious curiosity was
      fully awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouldering the heavy block with the greatest ease, Mauger directed
      Wolfytt to bring a bundle of straw from a heap in the corner, and
      extinguishing the lamp, set forth. It was a sharp, frosty night, and the
      hard ground rang beneath their footsteps. There was no moon, but the stars
      twinkled brightly down, revealing every object with sufficient
      distinctness. As they passed Saint Thomas's Tower, Wolfytt laughingly
      pointed out Bret's head stuck upon a spike on the roof, and observed,&mdash;"That
      poor fellow made Xit a knight."

    </h5>
    <p>
      On reaching the Green, they found Manger's conjecture right&mdash;the
      scaffold was nearly finished. Two carpenters were at work upon it, nailing
      the planks to the posts, and the noise of their hammers resounded in sharp
      echoes from the surrounding habitations. Hurrying forward, Mauger ascended
      the steps, which were placed on the north, opposite Saint Peter's chapel,
      and deposited his burthen on the platform. He was followed more leisurely
      by Sorrocold; and Wolfytt, throwing the straw upon the ground, scrambled
      after them as well as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I had thought it was so sold, I would have taken another pull at the
      stone bottle," he said, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Warm yourself by helping the carpenter," replied Sorrocold gravely. "It
      will do you more good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Wolfytt laughed, and dropping on his knees, grasped the block with both
      hands, and placed his neck in the hollowed space.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I try whether I can take your head off?" demanded Mauger, feigning
      to draw his dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apprehensive that the jest might be carried a little too far, Wolfytt got
      up, and imitated, as well as his drunken condition would allow, the
      actions of a person addressing the multitude and preparing for execution.
      In bowing to receive the blessing of the priest, he missed his footing a
      second time, and rolled off the scaffold. He did not attempt to ascend
      again, but supported himself against one of the posts near the carpenters.
      Mauger and Sorrocold took no notice of him, but began to converse in an
      under tone about the apparition. In spite of himself, the executioner
      could not repress a feeling of dread, and the chirurgeon half-repented his
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, neither spoke, and Sorrocold's teeth chattered, partly with
      cold, partly with terror. Nothing broke the deathlike silence around,
      except the noise of the hammer, and ever and anon, a sullen and ominous
      roar proceeding from the direction of the Lions' Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it will appear?" inquired Sorrocold, whose blood ran cold at
      the latter awful sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not," replied Mauger&mdash;"All! there&mdash;there it is." And he
      pointed towards the church porch, from which a figure, robed in white, but
      unsubstantial almost as the mist, suddenly issued. It glided noiselessly
      along, and without turning its face towards the beholders. No one saw it
      except Mauger and Sorrocold, who followed its course with their eyes. The
      carpenters continued their work, and Wolfytt stared at his companions in
      stupid and inebriate wonderment. After making the complete circuit of the
      scaffold, the figure entered the church porch and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What think you of it?" demanded Mauger, as soon as he could find
      utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is marvellous and incomprehensible, and if I had not seen it with my
      own eyes, I could not have believed it," replied the churgeon. "It must be
      the shade of Anne Boleyn, she is buried in that chapel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," replied the executioner. "It is her spirit, there will be
      no further respite. Jane will die to-morrow."

    <h2>
      XLI.&mdash;OF THE UNION OF CHOLMONDELEY WITH ANGELA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he near approach
      of death found Jane as unshaken as before, or rather she rejoiced that her
      deliverance was at hand. Compelled to her infinite regret to hold a
      disputation with Fecken-ham, she exerted all her powers; and, as upon a
      former occasion, when opposed to a more formidable antagonist, Gardiner,
      came off victorious. But though defeated, the zealous confessor did not
      give up his point, trusting he should be able to weary her out. He,
      accordingly, passed the greater part of each day in her prison, and
      brought with him, at different times, Gardiner, Tunstal, Bonner, and other
      prelates, all of whom tried the effect of their reasoning upon her,&mdash;but
      with no avail. Bonner, who was of a fierce and intolerant nature, was so
      enraged, that on taking leave of her he said with much acrimony&mdash;"Farewell,
      madam. I am sorry for you and your obstinacy, and I am assured we shall
      never meet again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, my lord," replied Jane; "we never <i>shall</i> meet again, unless
      it shall please God to turn your heart. And I sincerely pray that he may
      send you his holy spirit, that your eyes may be opened to his truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor had the others better success. Aware that whatever she said would be
      reported to the disadvantage of the Protestant faith, if it could be so
      perverted, she determined to give them no handle for misrepresentation,
      and fought the good fight so gallantly that she lost not a single point,
      and wrung even from her enemies a reluctant admission of defeat. Those
      best skilled in all the subtleties of scholastic argument, could not
      perplex her. United to the most profound learning, she possessed a clear
      logical understanding, enabling her at once to unravel and expose the
      mysteries in which they sought to perplex her, while the questions she
      proposed in her turn were unanswerable. At first, she found Feckenham's
      visits irksome, but by degrees they became almost agreeable to her,
      because she felt she was at once serving the cause of the Gospel, and
      taken from her own thoughts. During all this time, Angela never for a
      moment quitted her, and though she took no part in the conferences, she
      profited greatly by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days before she suffered, Jane said to Feckenham, "You have often
      expressed a wish to serve me, reverend sir. There is one favour you <i>can</i>
      confer upon me if you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, madam?" he rejoined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before I die," returned Jane, "I would fain see Angela united to her
      lover, Cuthbert Cholmondeley. He was ever a faithful follower of my
      unfortunate husband, and he has exhibited a like devoted attachment to me.
      I know not whether you can confer this favour upon me, or whether you will
      do so if you can. But I venture, from your professions of regard for me,
      to ask it. If you consent, send, I pray you to Master John Bradford, pre
      bendary of Saint Paul's, and let him perform the ceremony in this
      chamber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bradford!" exclaimed Feckenham, frowning. "I know the obstinate and
      heretical preacher well. If you are willing that I should perform the
      ceremony, I will undertake to obtain the queen's permission for it. But it
      must not be done by Bradford."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I have nothing further to say," replied Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how comes it that you, Angela," said Feckenham, addressing her in a
      severe tone, "the daughter of Catholic parents, both of whom suffered for
      their faith, abandon it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A better light has been vouchsafed me," she replied, "and I lament that
      they were not equally favoured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, madam," observed Feckenham, to Jane, "you shall not say I am harsh
      with you. I desire to serve Angela, for her parents' sake&mdash;both of
      whom were very dear to me. I will make known your request to the queen,
      and I can almost promise it shall be granted on one condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On no condition affecting my opinions," said Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, madam," returned the confessor, with a half-smile, "I was about to
      propose nothing to which you can object. My condition is, that if Bradford
      is admitted to your prison, you exchange no word with him, except in
      reference to the object of his visit. That done, he must depart at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I readily agree to it," replied Jane, "and I thank you for your
      consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      After some further conference, Feckenham departed, and Angela, as soon as
      they were alone, warmly thanked Jane for her kindness, saying&mdash;"But
      why think of me at such a time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it will be a satisfaction to me to know that you are united to
      the object of your affections," replied Jane. "And now leave me to my
      devotions, and prepare yourself for what is to happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, she withdrew into the recess, and, occupied in fervent prayer,
      soon abstracted herself from all else. Three hours afterwards, Feckenham
      returned. He was accompanied by Cholmondeley, and a grave-looking divine
      in the habit of a minister of the Reformed Church, in whom Jane
      immediately recognised John Bradford,&mdash;the uncompromising preacher of
      the Gospel, who not long afterwards won his crown of martyrdom at
      Smithfield. Apparently, he knew why he was summoned, and the condition
      annexed to it, for he fixed an eye full of the deepest compassion and
      admiration upon Jane, but said nothing. Cholmondeley threw himself at her
      feet, and pressed her hand to his lips, but his utterance failed him. Jane
      raised him kindly and entreated him to command himself, saying, "I have
      not sent for you hero to afflict you, but to make you happy." &lt;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! madam," replied Cholmondcley, "you are ever more thoughtful for
      others than yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed with the ceremony without delay, sir," said Fleckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rely upon your word, madam, that you hold no conference with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You <i>may</i> rely upon it," returned Jane.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the confessor withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bradford then took from his vest a book of prayers, and in that
      prison-chamber, with Jane only as a witness, the ceremony was performed.
      At its conclusion, Angela observed to her husband&mdash;"We must separate
      as soon as united, for I shall never quit my dear mistress during her
      lifetime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should deeply regret it, if you did otherwise," returned Cholmondcley.
      "Would I had like permission to attend on Lord Guilford. But that is
      denied me."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of her husband's name, a shade passed over Jane's
      countenance&mdash;but she instantly checked the emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My blessing upon your union!" she cried, extending her hands over the
      pair, "and may it be happy&mdash;happier than mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" cried Bradford. "Before I take my leave, madam, I trust I shall
      not transgress the confessor's commands, if I request you to write your
      name in this book of prayers. It will stimulate me in my devotions, and
      may perchance cheer me in a trial like your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane readily complied, and taking the book, wrote a short prayer in the
      blank leaf, and subscribed it with her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is but a slight return for your compliance with my request, Master
      Bradford," she said, as she returned the book, "but it is all I have to
      offer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall prize it more than the richest gift," replied the preacher.
      "Farewell, madam, and doubt not I shall pray constantly for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you heartily, sir," she rejoined. "You must go with him,
      Cholmondeley," she continued, perceiving that the esquire lingered&mdash;"We
      must now part for ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, madam," cried Cholmondeley, again prostrating himself before
      her, and pressing her hand to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Angela, you must lead him forth," observed Jane, kindly, though a
      tear started to her eye. And she withdrew into an embrasure, while
      Cholmondeley, utterly unable to control his distress, rushed forth, and
      was followed by Bradford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's benediction did not fall to the ground. When the tragic event,
      which it is the purpose of this chronicle to relate, was over, Angela fell
      into a dangerous illness, during which her husband watched over her with
      the greatest solicitude. Long before her recovery, he had been liberated
      by Mary, and as soon as she was fully restored to health, they retired to
      his family seat, in Cheshire, where they passed many years of
      uninterrupted happiness,&mdash;saddened,&mdash;but not painfully,&mdash;by
      the recollection of the past.

    <h2>
      XLII.&mdash;THE EXECUTION OF LADY JANE GREY.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>onday, the 12th of
      February, 1554, the fatal day destined to terminate Jane's earthly
      sufferings, at length, arrived. Excepting a couple of hours which she
      allowed to rest, at the urgent entreaty of her companion, she had passed
      the whole of the night in prayer. Angela kept watch over the lovely
      sleeper, and the effect produced by the contemplation of her features
      during this her last slumber, was never afterwards effaced. The repose of
      an infant could not be more calm and holy. A celestial smile irradiated
      her countenance; her lips moved as if in prayer; and if good angels are
      ever permitted to visit the dreams of those they love on earth, they
      hovered that night over the couch of Jane. Thinking it cruelty to disturb
      her from such a blissful state, Angela let an hour pass beyond the
      appointed time. But observing a change come over her countenance,&mdash;seeing
      her bosom heave, and tears gather beneath her eye-lashes, she touched her,
      and Jane instantly arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it four o'clock?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has just struck five, madam," replied Angela. "I have disobeyed you
      for the first and last time. But you seemed so happy, that I could not
      find in my heart to waken you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>was</i> happy," replied Jane, "for I dreamed that all was over&mdash;without
      pain to me&mdash;and that my soul was borne to regions of celestial bliss
      by a troop of angels who had hovered above the scaffold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be so, madam," replied Angela, fervently. "You will quit this
      earth immediately for heaven, where you will rejoin your husband in
      everlasting happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust so," replied Jane, in an altered tone, "but in that blessed place
      I searched in vain for him. Angela, you let me sleep too long, or not long
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your pardon, dearest madam," cried the other, fearfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, you have given me no offence," returned Jane, kindly. "What I meant
      was that I had not time to find my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh you <i>will</i> find him, dearest madam," returned Angela, "doubt it
      not. Your prayers would wash out his offences, even if his own could not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust so," replied Jane. "And I will now pray for him, and do you pray
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane then retired to the recess, and in the gloom, for it was yet dark,
      continued her devotions until the clock struck seven. She then arose, and
      assisted by Angela attired herself with great care.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pay more attention to the decoration of my body now I am about to part
      with it," she observed, "than I would do, if it was to serve me longer. So
      joyful is the occasion to me, that were I to consult my own feelings, I
      would put on my richest apparel to indicate my contentment of heart. I
      will not, however, so brave my fate, but array myself in these weeds." And
      she put on a gown of black velvet, without ornament of any kind; tying
      round her slender throat (so soon alas! to be severed) a simple white
      falling collar. Her hair was left purposely unbraided, and was confined by
      a caul of black velvet. As Angela performed those sad services, she sobbed
      audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, cheer thee, child," observed Jane. "When I was clothed in the robes
      of royalty, and had the crown placed upon my brow,&mdash;nay, when arrayed
      on my wedding-day,&mdash;I felt not half so joyful as now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! madam!" exclaimed Angela, in a paroxysm of grief. "My condition is
      more pitiable than yours. You go to certain happiness. But I lose you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only for a while, dear Angela," returned Jane. "Comfort yourself with
      that thought. Let my fate be a warning to you. Be not dazzled by ambition.
      Had I not once yielded, I had never thus perished. Discharge your duty
      strictly to your eternal and your temporal rulers, and rest assured we
      shall meet again,&mdash;never to part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your counsel shall be graven on my heart, madam," returned Angela. "And
      oh! may my end be as happy as yours!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven grant it!" ejaculated Jane, fervently. "And now," she added, as
      her toilette was ended, "I am ready to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not take some refreshment, madam?" asked Angela.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Jane. "I have done with the body!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was damp and dark. A thaw came on a little before day-break,
      and a drizzling shower of rain fell. This was succeeded by a thick mist,
      and the whole of the fortress was for a while enveloped in vapour. It
      brought to Jane's mind the day on which she was taken to trial. But a
      moral gloom likewise overspread the fortress. Every one within it, save
      her few enemies, (and they were few indeed,) lamented Jane's approaching
      fate. Her youth, her innocence, her piety, touched the sternest breast,
      and moved the pity even of her persecutors. All felt that morning as if
      some dire calamity was at hand, and instead of looking forward to the
      execution as an exciting spectacle (for so such revolting exhibitions were
      then considered,) they wished it over. Many a prayer was breathed for the
      speedy release of the sufferer&mdash;many a sigh heaved&mdash;many a groan
      uttered: and if ever soul was wafted to Heaven by the fervent wishes of
      those on earth, Jane's was so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late before there were any signs of stir and bustle within the
      fortress. Even the soldiers gathered together reluctantly&mdash;and those
      who conversed, spoke in whispers. Dudley, who it has been stated was
      imprisoned in the Beauchamp Tower, had passed the greater part of the
      night in devotion. But towards morning, he became restless and uneasy, and
      unable to compose himself, resorted to the customary employment of
      captives in such cases, and with a nail which he had found, carved his
      wife's name in two places on the walls of his prison. These inscriptions
      still remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nine o'clock, the bell of the chapel began to toll, and an escort of
      halberdiers and arquebussiers drew up before the Beauchamp Tower, while
      Sir Thomas Brydges and Feckenham entered the chamber of the prisoner, who
      received them with an unmoved countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before you set out upon a journey from which you will never return, my
      lord," said Feckenham, "I would ask you for the last time, if any change
      has taken place in your religious sentiments&mdash;and whether you are yet
      alive to the welfare of your soul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not promise me pardon if I will recant on the scaffold, and silence
      me as you silenced the duke my father, by the axe!" replied Dudley,
      sternly. "No, sir, I will have naught to do with your false and idolatrous
      creed. I shall die a firm believer in the gospel, and trust to be saved by
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then perish, body and soul," replied Feckenham, harshly. "Sir Thomas
      Brydges, I commit him to your hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I to be allowed no parting with my wife?" demanded Dudley, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have parted with her for ever,&mdash;heretic and unbeliever!"
      rejoined Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That speech will haunt your death-bed, sir," retorted Dudley, sternly.
      And he turned to the lieutenant, and signified that he was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first object that met Dudley's gaze, as he issued from his prison, was
      the scaffold on the green. He looked at it for a moment, wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is for Lady Jane," observed the lieutenant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it," replied Dudley, in a voice of intense emotion.&mdash;"I thank
      you for letting me die first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must thank the queen, my lord," returned Brydges. "It was her order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall you see my wife, sir?" demanded Dudley, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lieutenant answered in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her I will be with her on the scaffold," said Dudley.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was about to set forward, a young man pushed through the lines of
      halberdiers, and threw himself at his feet. It was Cholmondeley. Dudley
      instantly raised and embraced him. "At least I sec one whom I love," he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, this interruption must not be," observed the lieutenant. "If you
      do not retire," he added, to Cholmondeley, "I shall place you in arrest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, my dear lord," cried the weeping esquire&mdash;"farewell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, for ever!"&mdash;returned Dudley, as Cholmondeley was forced
      back by the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The escort then moved forward, and the lieutenant accompanied the prisoner
      to the gateway of the Middle Tower, where he delivered him to the sheriffs
      and their officers, who were waiting there for him with a Franciscan
      friar, and then returned to fulfil his more painful duty. A vast crowd was
      collected on Tower Hill, and the strongest commiseration was expressed for
      Dudley, as he was led to the scaffold, on which Mauger had already taken
      his station.
    </p>
    <p>
      On quitting the Beauchamp Tower, Feckenham proceeded to Jane's prison. He
      found her on her knees, but she immediately arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it time?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, madam,&mdash;to repent," replied Feckenham, sternly. "A few
      minutes are all that now remain to you of life&mdash;nay, at this moment,
      perhaps, your husband is called before his Eternal Judge. There is yet
      time. Do not perish like him in your sins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven have mercy upon him!" cried Jane, falling on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      And notwithstanding the importunities of the confessor, she continued in
      fervent prayer, till the appearance of Sir Thomas Brydges. She instantly
      understood why he came, and rising, prepared for departure. Almost blinded
      by tears, Angela rendered her the last services she required. This done,
      the lieutenant, who was likewise greatly affected, begged some slight
      remembrance of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to give you but this book of prayers, sir," she answered&mdash;"but
      you shall have that, when I have done with it, and may it profit you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will receive it only to cast it into the flames, my son," remarked
      Feckenham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I shall treasure it like a priceless gem," replied
      Brydges.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find a prayer written in it in my own hand," said Jane.&mdash;"And
      again I say, may it profit you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Brydges then passed through the door, and Jane followed him. A band of
      halberdiers were without. At the sight of her, a deep and general sympathy
      was manifested; not an eye was dry; and tears trickled down cheeks
      unaccustomed to such moisture. The melancholy train proceeded at a slow
      pace. Jane fixed her eyes upon the prayer-book, which she read aloud to
      drown the importunities of the confessor, who walked on her right, while
      Angela kept near her on the other side. And so they reached the green.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the fog had cleared off, and the rain had ceased; but the
      atmosphere was humid, and the day lowering and gloomy. Very few spectators
      were assembled,&mdash;for it required firm nerves to witness such a
      tragedy. A flock of carrion-crows and ravens, attracted by their fearful
      instinct, wheeled around overhead, or settled on the branches of the bare
      and leafless trees, and by their croaking added to the dismal character of
      the scene. The bell continued tolling all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sole person upon the scaffold was Wolfytt. He was occupied in
      scattering straw near the block. Among the bystanders was Sorrocold
      leaning on his staff; and as Jane for a moment raised her eyes as she
      passed along, she perceived Roger Ascham. Her old preceptor had obeyed
      her, and she repaid him with a look of gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the lieutenant's directions, she was conducted for a short time into
      the Beauchamp Tower, and here Feckenham continued his persecutions, until
      a deep groan arose among those without, and an officer abruptly entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said Sir John Brydges, after the new-comer had delivered his
      message, "we must set forth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane made a motion of assent, and the party issued from the Beauchamp
      Tower, in front of which a band of halberdiers was drawn up. A wide open
      space was kept clear around the scaffold. Jane seemed unconscious of all
      that was passing. Preceded by the lieutenant, who took his way towards the
      north of the scaffold, and attended on either side by Feckenham and Angela
      as before, she kept her eyes steadily fixed on her prayer-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived within a short distance of the fatal spot, she was startled by a
      scream from Angela, and looking up, beheld four soldiers, carrying a
      litter covered with a cloth, and advancing toward her. She knew it was the
      body of her husband, and unprepared for so terrible an encounter, uttered
      a cry of horror. The bearers of the litter passed on, and entered the
      porch of the chapel.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0523.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      While this took place, Mauger, who had limped back as fast as he could
      after his bloody work on Tower I Till,&mdash;only tarrying a moment to
      exchange his axe,&mdash;ascended the steps of the scaffold, and ordered
      Wolfytt to get down. Sir Thomas Brydges, who was greatly shocked at what
      had just occurred, and would have prevented it if it had been possible,
      returned to Jane and offered her his assistance. But she did not require
      it. The force of the shock had passed away, and she firmly mounted the
      scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was seen there, a groan of compassion arose from the spectators,
      and prayers were audibly uttered. She then advanced to the rail, and, in a
      clear distinct voice, spoke as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray you all to bear me witness that I die a true Christian woman, and
      that I look to be saved by no other means except the mercy of God, and the
      merits of the blood of his only son Jesus Christ. I confess when I knew
      the word of God I neglected it, and loved myself and the world, and
      therefore this punishment is a just return for my sins. But I thank God of
      his goodness that he has given me a time and respite to repent. And now
      good people, while I am alive, I pray you assist me with your prayers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many fervent responses followed, and several of the by-standers imitated
      Jane's example, as, on the conclusion of her speech, she fell on her knees
      and recited the <i>Miserere.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      At its close, Feckenham said in a loud voice, "I ask you, madam, for the
      last time, will you repent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray you, sir, to desist," replied Jane, meekly. "I am now at peace
      with all the world, and would die so."
    </p>
    <p>
      She then arose, and giving the prayer-book to Angela, said,&mdash;"When
      all is over, deliver this to the lieutenant. These," she added, taking off
      her gloves and collar, "I give to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to me," cried Mauger, advancing and prostrating himself before her
      according to custom, "you give grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And also my head," replied Jane. "I forgive thee heartily, fellow. Thou
      art my best friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What ails you, madam?" remarked the lieutenant, observing Jane suddenly
      start and tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much," she replied, "but I thought I saw my husband pale and
      bleeding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" demanded the lieutenant, recalling Dudley's speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, near the block," replied Jane. "I see the figure still. But it
      must be mere fantasy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever his thoughts were, the lieutenant made no reply; and Jane turned
      to Angela, who now began, with trembling hands, to remove her attire, and
      was trying to take off her velvet robe, when Mauger offered to assist her,
      but was instantly repulsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then withdrew, and stationing himself by the block, assumed his hideous
      black mask, and shouldered his axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partially disrobed, Jane bowed her head, while Angela tied a kerchief over
      her eyes, and turned her long tresses over her head to be out of the way.
      Unable to control herself, she then turned aside, and wept aloud. Jane
      moved forward in search of the block, but fearful of making a false step,
      felt for it with her hands, and cried&mdash;"What shall I do?&mdash;Where
      is it?&mdash;Where is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Thomas Brydges took her hand and guided her to it. At this awful
      moment, there was a slight movement in the crowd, some of whom pressed
      nearer the scaffold, and amongst others Sorrocold and Wolfytt. The latter
      caught hold of the boards to obtain a better view. Angela placed her hands
      before her eyes, and would have suspended her being, if she could; and
      even Feckenham veiled his countenance with his robe. Sir Thomas Brydges
      gazed firmly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, Jane had placed her head on the block, and her last words
      were, "Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The axe then fell, and one of the fairest and wisest heads that ever sat
      on human shoulders, fell likewise.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
